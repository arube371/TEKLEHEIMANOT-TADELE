ABSTRACT
This thesis seeks to provide a greater depth into the exploration of the subject “Vehicle
Maintenance Management System” (VMMS). It is found that improved maintenance helps
to increase revenues of a firm by increasing vehicle or equipment performance and
availability. Most importantly, firms must have maintenance policies and strategies so that
the whole firm will be directed in the same direction to reduce equipment down time.
The purpose of this thesis is to improve the existing maintenance management system and
maintenance efficiency of the enterprise under consideration.
The establishment of effective and efficient maintenance management system is the
mechanism by which controllable costs are reduced and equipment availability is increased.
Controllable costs are the costs incurred due to improper decision during purchasing process
by selecting incompatible and cheap price items with out considering reliability and
maintainability, and costs incurred due to poor maintenance management system practiced
during operation. Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to examine the existing
maintenance of Walia Intercity Bus Service Enterprise (WIBSE) and recommend better
maintenance management system that enhances vehicle availability with reasonable
maintenance cost. The author believes upon implementation of the recommended
maintenance management system, availability of vehicles for transportation and useful life
are expected to increase due to minimizing of down time and abuse.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Business enterprises use complex equipment to deliver products and services. The failure of
their equipment can cause serious social and economic consequences. However,
maintenance activities on these equipments are often neglected, either for short-term cost
savings from lower maintenance activities or due to lack of awareness on importance of
maintenance by top management.
However, various organization are starting to realize that cost-effective maintenance
results in better efficiencies, higher availability of equipment and more profit and savings
with regards to their strategic and operational objectives.
Equipment failures are rectified through corrective maintenance actions while preventive
maintenance actions are used to reduce the recurrence of failure.
All these maintenance actions resulted additional cost. Therefore, maintenance must be done
so as to achieve the objectives of the organization, making a rational between corrective and
preventive maintenance. The enterprise under consideration (Walia Intercity bus service
Enterprise) is one of the organizations engaged in bus transportation service. The enterprise
has more than 12 years of experience in road transportation service. It plays indispensable
role in linking the major centers in the country. But from time to time the enterprise faced
with increasing down time of vehicles, higher repair costs, too many obsolescence, and
financial losses
1.2 Statement of the problem
In many vehicle maintenance providers, in Ethiopia, the vehicle maintenance record
keeping and failure analysis culture is very poor. Maintenance is performed without any
manual procedure on breakdown based; this decreases the economic service life of vehicles
and lacks critical information on the vehicles’ status, for its replacement or disposal.
Walia Intercity Bus Service Enterprise follows reactive and minor lube type of maintenance.
This causes higher down time, road call accidents and more obsolete vehicles. As a result
the enterprises cumulative loss reaches 42 million Birr. This is because; the maintenance
procedure is not according to the points which can be derived from proper maintenance
2
record and analysis. Hence the thesis work seeks to improve the current maintenance
management system.
1.3 Objective of the thesis
As a result of effective and efficient maintenance management, it is possible to prolong the
physical, technical and economic service time of vehicles/equipment. Thus the main
objective of this thesis is to analyze the current system of vehicle maintenance management
system of WIBSE and to recommend improved vehicle maintenance management system. In
this thesis, the design and implementation of rational maintenance system, work
standardization procedure, and appropriate organizational structure with efficient personnel
who can accomplish the task encountered is recommended.
1.4 Methodology
In order to achieve the objectives of the thesis, the methodologies followed are:
(a) Literature survey:-To be familiar with the concepts of maintenance, maintenance
management system and performance improvement, literature review was carried out.
Articles and journals are also reviewed to reinforce the current maintenance practices of the
enterprise
(b) Data collection: - review of available data in WIBSE such as general operating costs
and maintenance costs, types of maintenance practices, frequency of break down including
road calls, resource consumption are collected and examined. Direct observation on
maintenance process of the enterprises and non structured interviews with technical
personnel, supervisors, store men as well supply and maintenance managers assist to
identify the problems.
(c) Existing system analysis and system design: - after identifying the problems in the
enterprise, recommendations are presented which enable to improve the maintenance
management system.
1.5 Organization of the paper
The thesis consists of seven chapters that discuss the means and modalities that enable to
establish and implement effective and efficient maintenance management system. The first
chapter deals with introduction in which the background and objectives of the thesis work
are briefly pointed out, besides, the methodologies applied are enlightened.
3
Chapter two is concerned with the literature review on maintenance and maintenance
management system. This chapter comprises different authors work on maintenance and
maintenance management.
In Chapter three, the existing maintenance management system of WIBSE is assessed by the
help of data collected from the enterprise and its existing problems and strengths are
discussed.
Chapter four discusses standardization and codification system. The benefits that can be
obtained by establishing good standardization and codification in maintenance work are
presented.
Chapter five mainly deals with preventive maintenance programs and their implementation
to increase WIBSE vehicles availability. The factors to be considered in developing and
implementing maintenance planning, scheduling and controlling systems are presented.
In chapter six the existing organizational structure of WIBSE is presented and discussed
inline with the issue to be addressed, the existing staff in the maintenance department is
analyzed. Based on the existing situation, appropriate and reasonable organizational
structure is recommended. Furthermore, the type of training required to develop and upgrade
the enterprise’s working personnel and the training institutes available in the country to
conduct the necessary training are identified.
In the final chapter (chapter 7), conclusion and recommendations to implement the proposed
maintenance management system are made.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 The status of maintenance
In the United States, it was estimated that in 1979 over $200 billion was spent on
maintenance. However, more disturbing than the amount was the fact that approximately
one-third of that total was spent unnecessarily. As we continue to the present, there has been
no significant change in maintenance policy, indicating the unnecessary cost trend is
probably still one-third and the largest change in the maintenance costs is the amount. Since
1979 maintenance cost has risen between 10 and 15% per year. If this amount is calculated,
it is very likely that the maintenance expenditures in the United States are now over one-half
a trillion dollars per year. Where do these unnecessary costs occur in maintenance? How can
they be controlled? These questions can best be answered by looking at some statistics.
According to Wireman [15 & 16]:
Less than 4hr/day (out of a possible 8) are spent by maintenance crafts men
performing hands-on work activities. This figure is even more alarming when it is realized
that the majority of maintenance organizations are performing as few as 2 hr of hands-on
work. It is not that these individuals are lazy or shrinking job responsibilities. It is the fact
that they are not provided the necessary resources by management to perform the assigned
job tasks. Providing these resources becomes important to increasing maintenance
productivity and producing substantial maintenance labor savings. If we would view
maintenance salaries as a resource, $20 per hour is paid and only utilizing this resource at a
50% level; that is a tremendous cost waste.
Only about one-third of all maintenance organization uses a job planner to plan
maintenance activities. Most experts agree this is one of the largest potential for cost savings
in the maintenance area. It is estimated that planned versus unplanned work may have a cost
ratio as high as 1:5 performing a $100 planned work could save as much as $400 over
performing the same job in unplanned mode.
The majority of all maintenance organizations either are dissatisfied with or do not
have work orders systems. This is one of the critical indicators of the status of a maintenance
organization. If a maintenance organization does not have a work order system in place that
works properly, it is impossible to measure or control maintenance activities.
5
Of companies that have work order systems (one-third of all companies) only about
one-third track the work orders in a craft backlog format (actual 10% of total organizations).
This format will permit the manager to make logical staffing decisions based on how much
work is projected for each craft. Being able to justify employment levels to upper
management is a necessary function of good maintenance management.
Of companies that have work order system, only one third compared their estimates
of the work order labor and materials to the actual figures. Again, this means only about
10% of all organizations carry out some form of performance monitoring. Successful
maintenance management requires performance monitoring.
Of the companies with work order system that allows for feedback, only one-third,
again about 10% of all companies, perform any failure analysis on their breakdowns.
Most of the other companies are just parts changers. For an operation to be cost effective,
good practice in failure analysis must be followed.
Over time, another key indicator, in the United States averages about 14.1% of the
total time worked by maintenance organizations. This figure is almost three times what it
should be. Since maintenance is working so much overtime, it again indicates the reactive
situation that is standard in the industry. Reducing overtime is essential if a maintenance
organization is to be truly cost effective.
Preventive maintenance, another major part of any successful maintenance program,
is presently satisfying the needs of about 22% of the maintenance organizations. This again
illustrates major problems for the maintenance organizations. Without successful preventive
maintenance programs, maintenance can only react to given situation. Preventive
maintenance allows the organization to plan better and reduce maintenance costs. Over
three-fourths of the organizations need major improvements in this area.
Related to preventive maintenance, almost three-fourths of the organizations have
some form of lube routes and procedures. While this fact seems to be positive on the
surface, it is not. Many of the organizations feel that preventive maintenance is nothing
more than lube routes and procedures. So once they have these developed, they stop.
However, preventive maintenance encompasses much more than lube-routes. To be
successful, maintenance organizations must go beyond the preliminaries and fully develop
preventive maintenance programs.
6
One final fact related to preventive maintenance is the lack of coordination between
operations/ facilities and maintenance. Almost three-fourths of all organizations experience
problems in coordinating preventive maintenance with the operations/facilities group. The
problem is with communication. Either the maintenance organization has not communicated
the need for the preventive maintenance or the operation/facilities group is not listening.
Good, credible communication must be established if preventive maintenance is to be
effective.
Second only to maintenance labor is the cost of maintenance materials. Depending
on the type of operations / facility maintenance, materials can range between 20 and 70% of
the maintenance budget.
To manage maintenance successfully, materials must be given close scrutiny.
Many companies try to remedy maintenance materials problems by over stocking
the storeroom. This is a problem because most will not take in to account that inventory
carrying costs are over 30% of the price of the items per year. So, for example, the cost of
carrying $1 million inventory is over $300,000.00 per year. It is for this reason the
inventories must be kept low, while still providing for a satisfactory level of service.
A third point of concern for maintenance materials is that maintenance is only
responsible for their inventory in about 50% of the organizations. This means the other 50%
of the time, another body is telling maintenance department what they should stock and how
many they can issue.
While most thus agree that maintenance costs are high, they do not know how high
they are for their own site. In most cases, the costs of maintenance repairs are calculated as
the cost of maintenance labor and the maintenance materials to effect the repair. What larger
figure that is not added is the cost of lost production/service. The range for this cost may be
from 2 to 15 times the cost of the maintenance repair. The average is usually 4 to 1. So while
a maintenance repair in labor and materials may be 10,000.00, the actual cost is really closer
to 50,000.00. In fact, it is estimated that in the next several years the annual maintenance
cost will exceed the amount spent on yearly new capital investment.
2.1.1 The essential of maintenance
“Components, sub-units, subsystems, systems of equipment and vehicles are
designed, manufactured and assembled from processes raw materials and energy by the aid
7
of human labor and necessary tools. Their manufacturing and assembling process follow
scientific laws in an economic way that will be achieved by maximizing performance and
quality vehicles reducing costs. Furthermore, in order to continuously perform their intended
mission or be available to perform their mission when needed, the following factors have to
be analyzed and determined thoroughly during, manufacturing and assembling process.
These factors are:
Reliability:-The ability of an item to perform a required function under stated conditions for
a stated period of time. With this regard, during designing, manufacturing and assembling
activities, care must be taken in order to maintain high reliability of operations at an
accepted added cost.
Maintainability:-The ability of an equipment/vehicle under stated conditions of use to be
retained or restored to a state in which it can give its original performance, when
maintenance is performed under stated conditions and using stated procedure and resources.
Availability:-The ability of equipment/vehicle to function properly, despite occurrence of
failures, disturbances and limitations in the maintenance resources.
Human factor (ergonomics): -human factors refer to the design of a system or a
product/service with the human being in mind that is the design for operability and ease of
maintenance. Considerations include physical dimensions of the human body, human
sensory factors (sight or vision, hearing, feel or touch, smell, physical factors the effects of
environmental stress on the body) and psychological factors pertaining to the human mind
emotions, traits, attitudinal response, and behavioral patterns as they relate to job
performance.
With the above consideration, during designing, manufacturing and assembling of parts,
components, sub units, subsystems and systems of equipment or a vehicle are manufactured
for a limited life span. If errors are committed during designing, manufacturing and
assembling process, the expected life span of the machine systems, sub systems, sub-units
and components will be less than the expected life. Thus, in order to prolong the expected
service life of equipment/vehicle or rectify the intended problem encountered especially
during manufacturing and assembling, it is necessary to conduct maintenance activities on
equipment/vehicles.
8
2.1.2 Definitions of Maintenance
Maintenance can be defined as those activities required to up-keep a facility in as built
condition, so that it continues to have its original productive capacity [4]
Depending on designer limitation of life span, manufacturer recommendations, age and
service conditions of equipment/vehicle, it is possible to adopt the particular maintenance
types along with their implementation interval.
According to the Oxford Dictionary, “maintenance is defined as, ‘the act of
maintaining or the state of being maintained; the work of keeping something in proper
condition; upkeep”. In the context of industrial sector, maintenance can be defined as actions
to control the deterioration process leading to the failure of a system, which is often called
“preventive maintenance”, and the restoring of the system to its operational state through
corrective actions after the occurrence of failure, often called “corrective maintenance”.
From the above definitions, it can be seen that maintenance is necessary to keep any product
or system, with a finite life span, operating at an acceptable level, so as to support the needs
of the user or organization.
Maintenance may be categorized in to the following major types [4]:
1. As required maintenance: “as required maintenance is simply doing maintenance works
as the need develops (arise). This type of maintenance is applied for non-critical equipments.
2. Corrective maintenance: corrective maintenance covers all maintenance activities that
are carried out in order to correct (repair) a fault in equipment/ vehicle. It may include
emergency or break down maintenance.
3. Conditioned based maintenance: is a maintenance activity conducted to prevent failures
before it happens using sensing, measuring, or condition monitoring devices to detect wear
stages.
4. Preventive maintenance: PM is done to prevent the occurrence of failures and to detect
failures before they develop to break down or disturbances in operation (product/service).
Preventive maintenance has become a term with broad definition. The generic definition of
PM is any planned maintenance activity that is designed to improve equipment life and
avoid any unplanned maintenance activity. In its simplest form it can be compared to the
service schedule for vehicle. There are certain tasks scheduled at varying frequencies, all
designed to keep the vehicle from experiencing any unexpected breakdowns.
9
PM activities that help to avoid failure of equipment are listed in [14] as follows:
• Equipment inspections to uncover deficiencies before failure and in sufficient time to plan
deliberate repairs;
• Non-destructive testing techniques (predictive maintenance) to detect equipment
deterioration and monitor equipment to note abnormal operation;
• Routine maintenance such as lubrication to reduce friction that causes heat, wear,
misalignment, or seizure;
• Routine, cleaning and adjusting done in conjunction with inspection or lubrication, or
performed by frontline operators;
• Replacement of minor components to reduce chances of more important components
failing;
It is recommended that maintenance being cause and effect situations, it is logical
that efforts be directed towards correction of the causes, rather than continuing to treat the
effects [9]. Therefore, it is feasible and economical to adopt a mechanism by which
maintenance is conducted to prevent the cause of failures and detect the failures before it
occurred. It is recommendable to adopt preventive maintenance when:
· Corrective maintenance cannot be justified
· Condition based maintenance cannot be applied and
· As required maintenance effects cannot be tolerated
In preparing this thesis, concepts are drawn and ideas are incorporated from various
works of different authors whose contributions have been significant in the development of
maintenance function, and maintenance management. The works of the authors’ quoted in
[9], [4], [15, 16& 23], [6], [7] and [12] can be summarized as follows:
· Maintenance department shall be organized based on some universal truths and
modified to adopt it to different sizes and sections according to the following
parameters:
¾ Plant size and type
¾ Company policy
¾ Industry wide and sectional precedent
¾ Particular technical, geographical and personnel situations involved
¾ State of training and reliability work and
10
¾ Available facilities
· Maintenance work shall be as much as possible preventive
· Maintenance planning and control system is crucial for implementation and cost
effectiveness of maintenance
· Computerized maintenance management system is necessary
· Maintenance system can be centralized or decentralized
Theories and facts described in their work relevant to maintenance management system are
assessed and adopted to solve the identified problems of vehicle maintenance of WIBSE.
The objectives of standardization, codifications and their application or economic benefits,
which are adopted in this thesis work are stated, [2]. Additionally, he has shown the three
categories of equipment life. These are economic life, profit life, and physical life. “ The
physical life is the age which the equipment/vehicle is exhausted and can no longer produce/
give service. At this point it will usually be abandoned or scraped; Profit life is the life over
which it can earn a profit; retention beyond that point will create loss. The economic life of a
machine/vehicle is the life, which maximizes profit over the lifetime of the enterprises.
The framework of maintenance workflow system and the accompanying formats in their
work is presented in, [3] & [4]. These systems and formats with that of WIBSE vehicle
maintenance management system were used in development of maintenance work flow
system of WIBSE. Ideas and concepts relevant to forecasting of spare parts requirement is
incorporated in this thesis [17]. In a similar manner the objectives of spare parts
management that have been shown in [5] works are assessed and relevant concepts are
incorporated.
Dolce [1] listed in his work basic factors that have to be considered in vehicles replacement
strategy. The replacement strategy was based on analysis of life cycle costs. The concepts
are assessed and incorporated in this work.
In motor vehicles fixed-time replacement of major parts is becoming complex due to
accelerated wear of these parts, as a result of operation in hazardous condition or abuse by
drivers in addition to deviations of useful life from the mean. Thus in most service manuals
of motor vehicles and earth moving equipments, a preventive maintenance program based
on fixed time replacement of fast moving items, gaskets, filters, seals, lubricants and
condition based replacement or overhaul of complex items and sub-units are recommended.
11
The replacement or inspection intervals are given in mileage or distance traveled in KM for
vehicles, and in operating hours for earth moving equipments and or other equipments.
In general, most literature on maintenance states that the objectives of maintenance
management shall be to develop systematic procedure of planning, execution and evaluation
of maintenance with objectives of increasing equipment/ vehicle availability by decreasing
down time due to breakdowns.
2.2 Maintenance Management System Objectives
Maintenance management is concerned with the good control of the maintenance
function and its related areas in order to best assist the objectives and goals of the entire
organization. It is a combination of all technical and administrative actions to retain an item
in, or restore it to the state which it can perform its requirements under normal stated
operating conditions. In short, maintenance management can simply be defined as managing
the maintenance activities to ensure the availability of equipment and facilities and keeping
the downtime to a minimum. As such, maintenance management supports the effective
operation process by eliminating and reducing the frequency and severity of equipment
failures.
With the changes in the maintenance and the management techniques, there is a need to
provide an integrated approach that pulls together all of the design tools and maintenance
tools that exist into an integrated whole. This requirement is in the form of Maintenance
Management System, which when properly organized and established, is able to provide
personnel at all levels access to real-time information.
2.3 Maintenance Management System Framework
The fundamental approach of Maintenance Management System can be viewed as a
closed loop which is repeated in a continuous improvement program of maintenance and
information procedures. The Deming concept of Plan-Do-Check-Act is a common approach
[22] used by firms for recording of data, accounting for costs, developing management
information, updating equipment information, providing work ordering system, control of
preventive maintenance program and providing management control reports. Brief reviews
of the events that occur during each of the loop are as indicated below:
Plan: make plans to improve a given activity;
12
Do: carrying out the plans;
Check: follow-up or feedback actions;
Act: making corrections if necessary.
This sets out a systematic approach for businesses to adhere to so as to ensure good
planning, productivity and efficiency of maintenance. To ensure that a Maintenance
Management System functions properly, several other sub-systems are necessary. These
sub-systems includes topics such as equipment breakdown analysis, planning and scheduling
of maintenance work, budget and forecasting, inventory control, training, accounting, work
order system, work standards, and data collections. The list mentioned is not exhaustive but
is considered to be more critical in the proper functioning of a Maintenance Management
System.
2.3.1 Work Order Records/systems
A Work Order System is the essential tool for keeping track of documents used to record
equipment maintenance tasks and provides the most important source of information for the
maintenance analysis and the writing of PM procedures. In other words, a good work order
system, with management commitment to its use, should produce quantifiable feedback on
overall maintenance performance, job and plant cost, and equipment history. These above
mentioned documents are called work order forms and there are several types and uses for
them, according to the particular needs of each company. The basic purposes of the Work
Order System according to Herbaty [13] are as indicated below:
· To provide a means for screening and authorizing work.
· To provide cost data segregated in a logical manner.
· To provide feedback information on repetitive failures for analysis purposes.
· To provide a tool to facilitate planning and scheduling of maintenance work.
· To facilitate control of productivity and performance of predictive and preventive
maintenance.
In most instances, different organization has varying needs. Therefore, the work order
system and its form used will vary across firms. Some general guidelines that apply to all
systems are listed as follows [24]:
13
· Work order forms should be numbered and at least three copies are needed in
connection with the control system.
· Only authorized supervisors approved by management can initiate work requests. A
list of designated supervisors’ names should be supplied to the work order section of
the maintenance department.
· Work orders are initiated only in the maintenance department. The work request
and/or work order form should be the basis for transmitting of information to all
crafts concerned.
· The work order is the basis for reporting time and material charges.
· The work order is the basis for accumulating records of job estimates and actual
costs for control and for improving estimates.
· The work order is the basis for work backlog reporting to control the size of the
maintenance work force.
· Despite the general guidelines mentioned above, certain functions are still vital for
achieving an efficient work order system as mentioned by Wireman [16] and
Herbaty [13]. These functions include work order number and definitions, work
order scheduling, setting job priorities and work order forms.
Work Order Number and Definitions
The work order number acts as a collection point for all information about the equipment
requesting maintenance work. A number is assigned to each maintenance work request, be it
planned, unplanned, emergency, or preventive maintenance. This number identifies the
specific maintenance request, the equipment’s maintenance charges (labor, material, etc.)
and its history information. With the number defined on the work order form, the definition
and description of the work to be performed and its priority rating must be assigned.
The setting of the priorities of jobs will be discussed under Setting Job Priorities.
Work Order Scheduling
Proper scheduling of the work request will enable estimation of many variables required for
the maintenance work such as man-hours, the skill type, and the materials required. This
helps the scheduler in better planning of the maintenance workforce and also estimation of
the cost involved.
Setting Job Priorities
14
In the case of a priority rating system, it brings objectivity and professionalism into the
planning and scheduling of maintenance work. For example, the customer requesting should
set this assigned rating but the priority rating may be reassessed and possibly changed
according to some set guidelines. The priority and type of work should be coded to ensure
consistency in assigning of the priority rating and identifying of the importance of the work.
For instance, a more urgent repair work for equipment with a higher priority rating will
affect the scheduling of other jobs.
Summary Reports
Information from the work order forms of completed jobs are input into the reports.
Maintenance department will then use the information to tabulate and churn out summary
reports in order to look at areas like maintenance cost, equipment criticality determination,
maintenance costs by type, equipment failure analysis, etc
Standards and improvement goals can be set with the information supplied by the summary
reports. Any below standard values can be investigated by referring to the individual work
order. Furthermore, the summary reports can also be used to assist in compiling various
reports, such as the Annual Equipment maintenance Report, the Monthly Parts Usage Report
by Equipment and the monthly year-to-date. Major Problem Reports Herbaty [13], which
highlight information for the long term or a specific period of time. Annual equipment
maintenance report summaries the cost incurred for the year by equipment number.
The format for such a report is as shown in table 2.1

2.3.2 Understanding Maintenance Planning
In the implementing of a maintenance plan, the terms preventive maintenance and
predictive maintenance are often used by those working in the maintenance engineering
16
department. With the implementation of preventive maintenance and predictive
maintenance, planning and scheduling of maintenance work will ensure lower cost and
better quality of the maintenance work than when maintenance work is performed on an
emergency or unscheduled basis.
2.3.3 Planning
Planning is the determination of all necessary elements required to perform a task in
advance of performing the job. It is the heart of good inspection and preventive
maintenance. Good planning ensures proactive maintenance strategies to provide effective
maintenance to the equipment. All maintenance work should be planned so that the quality
and cost effectiveness of the work is assured. To put it simply, planning is to provide an
accurate description of what is needed, e.g. manpower, tools, materials, and equipment, at
the proper time before the job is started. Good planning of maintenance function should
include:
• A general plan on the distribution of labor throughout the various departments under
“ normal” operating conditions.
• Detailed planning and scheduling of major events taking place during the year such as
major overhauls or rebuilds, large construction jobs, major preventive maintenance tasks and
vacations of maintenance workforce. Preventive maintenance tasks should include routine
maintenance, preventive maintenance, general repairs and emergency maintenance.
• Required spare parts, tools and other supply
From the standpoint of the business organization, the planning can be divided into three
basic levels, namely long range planning, short range planning and daily job planning [13].
Long Range Planning
Long range planning is to provide plans for future activities and improvements to the
maintenance function and can be for a period of five years or more. The primary purpose of
long range planning is to keep the maintenance objectives, policies, and procedures updated
so as to support the objectives of the company. Long range planners, usually reporting
directly to the president or vice president, must have good knowledge of sales and operation
forecast. As such, they are either from the upper management level or can be the
maintenance manager.
Short Range Planning
17
Short range planning is concerned with the annual plan of operation of the maintenance
function. This plan will specify how the maintenance workforce will operate during the
coming year and will also provide detailed plans for major rebuilds or overhauls, upgrading,
construction jobs, vacation planning, and also any changes to the production plan. Shortrange
plans should include preventive maintenance of periodic inspection, shutdown
planning, general repairs and non-destructive testing which is commonly known as
predictive maintenance. The list of common actions for short range planning is as indicated
below
· Periodic Inspection
· Daily Job Planning
· Shutdown Planning
· Analysis of Job
· General Repairs
· Common PM Actions
It can be emphasis that good planning of the maintenance function will assure productive
use of the available resources such as manpower, materials, equipments, etc. It will also
ensure that maintenance actions are on schedule, and that the execution is carried out
effectively and productively. Planning of the maintenance function must be performed
throughout the three levels of planning, namely, long range, short range and daily planning.
The various actions in each level of planning will require decision making and consensus
among all involved before implementation. This is to achieve overall commitment and team
spirit, even during times of trouble.
2.3.4 Scheduling
Scheduling is an important tool for ensuring high labor productivity and the orderly
accomplishment of maintenance tasks and actions. Scheduling is the action to arrange for
the availability of all the planned elements prior to the job execution. Two-way
communication between the operation and the maintenance department is critical so as to
ensure that any maintenance plans are made known to the operation department in advance.
It is equally important to ensure that the planned elements or resources are properly
scheduled so as to perform the job adequately. The typical elements required to perform a
job are listed below [13]:
• Labor • Equipment
• Material • Safety Lockouts
18
• Tools • Instructions
To ensure that all the planning effort is efficiently implemented, all the various maintenance
actions and tasks such as general repairs and overhauls, preventive maintenance,
lubrications, and routine maintenance must be all scheduled. Scheduling of maintenance
work can be divided into two main types, namely long range scheduling and short range
scheduling. The definition and properties of these two methods of scheduling are as
indicated below:
Long Range Scheduling
Long range maintenance scheduling, or master scheduling, is sometimes referred to as
working ahead of the schedule or forecasting. Forecasting is often employed in conjunction
with planning to help identify the desirable implementation dates, which often can be as
long as ten weeks ahead. This lead-time will ensure that the required personnel are made
aware of the proposed timing of the job and also allows for sufficient time for the planning
actions to be performed on time [14].
Short Range Schedule
Short-range schedule can be divided into weekly or daily schedules and is constructed from
the long-range schedules to provide for the orderly introduction of emergency work as it
occurs and the routine maintenance work. Short-range schedule permits the comparison of
labor and material resources with work requirements. As such, in the event that there are
more emergency repair works in a week, the subsequent weeks or weeks’ schedule can be
modified to complete unfinished work from the current week’ s schedule [14]. According to
Niebel [24], about 85% of the weekly schedule is based on general repairs and overhauls,
preventive and routine maintenance work while the remaining 15% is held open for
emergency work. However, if emergency work is occurring regularly and utilizing more
than 15% of the work force, an effort should be made to determine the causes.
Weekly Scheduling
In the planning of a weekly schedule, it is often useful to employ a two-week schedule [14].
The reason is that the planning function will not only provide for the work to be completed
in the current week, but also for the subsequent week. In this way, there will always be a
backlog of two weeks of work orders scheduled according to the priority. In the event of no
19
emergency work being requested and the weekly schedule is running ahead of time, advance
planned work can be brought forward for scheduling [13].
The second week schedule is more of an announcement used to point out subsequent jobs
and tasks that is coming up. Weekly schedule meetings should be held to assist the planners
and the related departments on the types of works that have been scheduled and also to
confirm that all the required craft, materials and tools are available [14]. It must be
understood that the weekly schedule should be realistic and should provide for an allowance
for absenteeism. This will prevent the occurrence of lack of manpower required to perform
the weekly scheduled tasks. “Approval” of the recommended weekly schedule in advance by
operation is a good way of ensuring that successful execution of a well planned schedule.
Daily Schedule
The daily work schedule is compiled from the weekly schedule by the maintenance
supervisor and is to be distributed the day before the schedule task. The need for such a
schedule is due to unforeseen changes in the planned weekly schedule. The reasons may be
due to some planned work taking more time than anticipated, shortages in materials or parts,
high rate of absenteeism or unexpected high rate of emergency work [24].
From this daily schedule, the jobs are assigned to craftsmen through work orders. The work
orders will provide all relevant details such as materials, special tools, a checklist of items
requiring performing of maintenance work, and also a feedback column. The daily schedule
allows for better control of the maintenance workforce and also caters to any emergency
repairs to be performed so as to keep the downtime or severity of the equipment to a
minimum.
Scheduling Format
In the process of scheduling maintenance work for any time frame, the planner/scheduler
must have taken into consideration several areas as to Herbaty [13]:
• Allocating of manpower • Scheduling of work
• Managing capacity and workload fluctuations • Managing of the manpower pool
• Estimating • Control of backlog
Allocating Manpower
In allocating manpower, the first step of the scheduling process is to prepare a labor
assignment sheet for each of the area maintenance units/groups as it is essential in the
20
preparation of the short or long-range schedule. These sheets, showing the distribution of
labor by craft, should be updated monthly and should include areas such unit capacity,
routine assignments, unavailable time, non routine assignments. A typical labor assignment
sheet is shown in Figure 2.1. The various areas on the labor assignment sheet are explained
as follows:
Unit Capacity: This is the number of permanently assigned personnel times 8 hours a day.
Pooled personnel or external contractors should not be included in this figure.
Routine Assignments: Routine assignment should be divided into two categories namely,
fixed assignments and variable assignments
Fixed: Assignments can further be divided into preventive maintenance assignments and
other fixed assignments. The preventive maintenance assignments are normal preventive
work performed on equipment that is stated in the preventive maintenance instructions. The
manpower needed according to prior planning should be set aside and left undisturbed. For
other fixed assignments, which are known maintenance work such as lubrication,
replacement of minor parts, janitorial work, etc and manpower can easily be calculated and
set aside.

D. Non routine Assignments

A-B-C= D 48
Each area Forman should prepare a separate labor assignment sheet for each trade
Figure2. 1 Labor Assignment Sheet Format [13]
From figure 2.1, the variable routine assignments are often of unknown magnitude and the
amount of manpower required for this type of work depends largely from past experience.
Examples of variable routine assignments include minor maintenance, operating surfaced
preventive maintenance, emergencies and minor repair.
Unavailable Time: This is the average time spent by the crew on absenteeism, vacations,
sick leave, coffee time, union business, etc. This figure can be obtained from past experience
and knowledge of the current situation.
Non Routine Assignments: A non routine assignment determine the amount of labor
available for any non routine jobs, and is equal to the equation as indicated below.
Non routine assignments = Unit capacity – Routine assignments – Unavailable time.
This category of work comprises practically all of the preplanned workload and is the major
scheduling task of the planner/scheduler.
22
Managing Capacity and Workload Fluctuations
The workload in any maintenance unit can be subdivided into fixed and variable categories.
Fixed categories include preventive maintenance and routine maintenance while variable
assignments include minor and major repairs, absences, vacation and sick leave according to
Herbaty [13]. The labor capacity available for any of these fixed and variable loads is itself a
variable as labor availability can be affected by:
• Absenteeism, vacations and sick leaves • Labor transferred to higher priority jobs
• Labor transferred to emergency jobs • Inability to obtain material or equipment
In other words, the labor capacity to meet the needs and demands of any load is dynamic
and constantly changing. Therefore, the labor capacity must be constantly and closely
monitored and adjusted to balance the load and capacity. Some common remedies include
working overtime, borrowing men with similar crafts from manpower pool and seeking
external contractors.
Estimating
Estimating should be performed on all non-routine work orders. As to Herbaty [13] the main
purposes and reasons of estimating are:
· To facilitate scheduling of the week’ s work
· To provide a basis for checking job productivity. The estimated and actual job costs
will show up on the completed work order printout. Any major difference in the
values can be due to incorrect estimating or other reasons.
· To provide a basis for work order approval as unknown cost figures will make
approval difficult.
· For backlog control. The summation of each work order estimate provides a
measure of the size of the backlog.
· To help in controlling low productivity caused by incorrect crew allocation.
Scheduling of Work
Scheduling of tasks depends mainly on the criticality and priority of jobs, and the amount of
manpower available. Routine and preventive maintenance tasks should have priority over
others as unmentioned equipment will have higher chance of failure, thereby creating
additional problems or failures. All necessary tools, materials and equipments for the
23
performing of maintenance tasks should be made available before scheduled work order is
released.
Managing the Manpower Pool
The maintenance workforce will be divided into units or groups and each leaded by a
foreman. The workload for these groups will vary on any given day and this is due to
breakdowns, changes in priorities, nature of jobs, and a wide variety of other reasons.
Furthermore, the group capacity available to perform the work will also vary for various
reasons such as absences, vacations, sick leaves, transfers to emergency or higher priority
jobs, terminations, etc. Therefore, planning and scheduling of maintenance work must take
into account all these manpower factors and make necessary adjustments to balance load
capacity. The adjustments that can be performed are as indicated below:
Insufficient Capacity/Excess Load
• Overtime • Inter-unit transfer
• Outsourcing • Allocation of manpower pool labor
• Delay, reduce or cancel work
Excess Capacity/Insufficient Load
• Schedule more backlog work • Bring forward selected preventive maintenance tasks
• Schedule deferred maintenance tasks
The above mentioned adjustments are some suggestion and will not definitely work for any
individual business. Careful considerations must be taken into account before coming to a
conclusion.
Control of Backlog
A record of backlog should be maintained so as to plan for vacations, to facilitate the work
planning effort and to make decisions on manpower including the need to hire fire or alter
the human resources in each maintenance group. Absence of documentation of backlog may
result in overload of tasks and may degrade the condition of the unspecified equipments
[13].
2.3.5 Maintenance Cost Control
Preventive maintenance is an operating cost necessary in ensuring that operational targets
are met. The benefits of an improved maintenance helps to increase revenues by increasing
equipment performance due to high efficiency, improve return of assets by reducing the
24
need for expensive capital upgrades and increasing output due to high availability. In terms
of operation, maintenance will to increase enable the uptime or availability of equipment, to
ensure attaining of high productivity and quality level. Budgeting is paramount importance
to control the various necessary costs in maintenance. Often is done by comparing manhours
used, labor cost accrued, material cost accumulated, and total cost committed. The
output of these costs is equipment, buildings or facilities maintained, activities performed, or
jobs completed. In order to control cost, effective use of labor, tools and materials must be
adhered to ensure a smooth operation of production equipment. There are some common
facts that people should know about maintenance cost control as indicated below according
to Tomlingson [14]:
· Most maintenance departments have a relatively stable work force, and total labor
cost variations are primarily due to overtime.
· Material costs are determined by volume of equipment that must be maintained and
the speed at which the equipment consumes spare parts and materials. Therefore, an
increase of emergency repairs will require more spare parts and materials than
normal routine and preventive maintenance programs.
· Labor costs in maintenance are incurred by the need to install spare parts and
performing the various maintenance tasks. However, a maintenance department
doing mostly emergency work usually works less productively as more labor is
consumed and the quality of work will tend to be poor as the works are performed in
reactive mode.
· Maintenance supervision tends to help in control of costs due to the efficiency with
which spare parts and materials are installed. Thus, the control of labor on their
quality and performance will become a vital maintenance activity.
· Better control of individual jobs is achieved through planning and scheduling. The
result will be completed jobs in less elapsed time, often with a reduction in cost and
with less consumption of manpower. Another significant improvement is that
downtime will be reduced and uptime is increased.
· With quality supervision, maintenance supervisors are able to control the quality of t
job and also maintain the potential benefit of planning. Supervision also tends to
result in better productivity and quicker completion of work.
25
· Successful cost control requires a work order information system that provides
information to judge performance and guide corrective actions.
Overall, it is vital for businesses to administer a system of good maintenance cost control to
assist in controlling of the labor and materials resources.
Reducing Maintenance Cost
With good planning and scheduling of the maintenance efforts, the maintenance department
should look at ways of reducing the overall maintenance cost without affecting the
efficiency of the maintenance function.
With good implementation of procedural maintenance actions, the discovery of problems
before failure occurs is possible. The final result will be less costly repair and less
downtime. This will indirectly reduce the rate of repairs and lower the use of spare parts.
Furthermore, a good repair history record that highlights the chronic, repetitive problems
and leads to their permanent correction can be helpful.
It is important for a business to impose a strict adherence to a regular PM Service schedule
to help to extend equipment life. Operation can also contribute to reducing the rate of parts
consumption by making equipment available for scheduled major repairs, as this is also a
sign of confidence in the maintenance program. One direct cost that will affect the
maintenance function is labor. In situation of immerse absenteeism, overtime is required for
planned jobs. This explains why successful businesses often have good human resource
system that curbs absenteeism which will affect the overall productivity and morale of the
firm.
To summaries, a successful cost reduction program requires the following to be established
according to Tomlingson [14]:
· Maintenance work must be approved before it is performed.
· All the maintenance work must be planned according to its scope, criticality, cost,
etc.
· Planned work must be prioritized
· Planned and prioritized work must be scheduled
· Schedule of major work should be subjected to labor allocation and deferred if not
certain.
26
· Use of manpower should be scrutinized; performance to be measured and any
questionable use of labor should be justified by maintenance supervision.
From the above, we can see that immense planning efforts are required to contribute to a
successful cost reduction.
Maintenance Controls
Control of the maintenance function is vital to achieve the set targets and objectives. During
the performance auditing, several questions should be raised for the maintenance controls.
These questions, as determined by Wireman [23] include:
1. Is the maintenance utilization report used?
2. Is crew absenteeism closely monitored?
3. Does overtime exceed 5% of the total man-hours worked?
4. Are external contractors used for routine jobs?
For the first two questions, the reply should yield positive answers while negative answers to
the last two questions will be desirable. In the event of discrepancies, actions needs to be
taken in the indicated area and the planning and control areas should be firmed up. Emphasis
should be placed on improving planning and increasing craft efficiencies. Improvements on
planning and scheduling functions must be made if productivity of employees has to
increase.
For excessive overtime scenario, a common situation known as “ fire-fighting” or
reactive style of maintenance is occurring and this is not cost effective at all. More often, the
maintenance crews are rushing to finish up on repair works and thus, overtime is needed to
ensure that all routine and preventive maintenance are performed. A solution will be to place
more emphasis on PM and predictive maintenance such as equipment testing and
inspections to help detect imminent failures in advance. By uncovering the problems early,
the emergency repair rate will be lowered eventually and the gradual improvement of the
excessive overtime situation. Wireman [23] also cited that the use of external contractors on
routine or repetitive jobs is a waste of resources and should be avoid wherever possible.
If the workload is such that the workforce cannot cover the routine jobs, there may be a need
to increase the staff number or to revamp the manpower utilization to remedy the situation.
As such, external contractors should only be used on large projects or when in-house
expertise is unavailable temporarily. If the expertise of a certain craftwork is creating a
27
loophole of requiring constant external contractor work, a good solution will be to select
personnel to undergo craft training to fill the gap.
Maintenance Backlog
According to Tomlingson [14], there are two purposes for having maintenance
backlog. They are to keep track of the rate of new maintenance work being generated and
also to help in determining the proper size and mix of the types of craftwork of the
workforce. An increase in the amount of backlog may be due to poor work order planning,
poor record keeping, and poor scheduling practices. The following questions should be
asked while considering the maintenance backlog:
a. Does the backlog forecast the required downtime?
b. Is the work prioritized for each craft?
c. Are the priorities properly applied and reliable?
d. Is the backlog used to control the size of the workforce?
The answer to the questions should reflect the conditions of the work order backlog. The
work requests should be planned and scheduled each day, considering the priorities, the
require completion dates, the availability of craft workers, materials, and equipment.
In the event that backlog becomes a problem, assigning accountability for the different
functions should help to eliminate the problem. However, it must be remembered that that
inefficient maintenance operation for years cannot be expected to change overnight. A
gradual implementation program must be used to help ease the old habits so that personnel
will have the time to adapt and change. Another solution will be to increase the size of
workforce to counter the increasing amount of backlog. However, this solution doesn’ t
counter the “ root” of the problem; that is the rational for the increase of backlog. Adding of
personnel can sometimes worsen the situation, as the imminent problems are not solved.

CHAPTER 3: ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM
3.1 Back ground of Walia Intercity Bus Service Enterprise (WIBSE)
In 1950’ s road transportation was one of the most profitable sectors in Ethiopia. More
individuals and unions appear to this sector and relatively free market was emerging. This
phenomenon had continued till command economy came in to action in middle of 1970’ s.
During the Dergue regime private public transportation was nationalized and by adding to
government buses “ Public Transport Corporation was established” by proclamation
No.107/69. After governmental change, in 1986 public transport corporation was split into
technique ,city bus service and cross-country service. As a result Walia intercity bus service
enterprise was established in 1987 by council of ministers regulation No.188/86 to provide
cross country transport services with initial paid up capital of 16,942,000 and authorized
capital of 21, 690,000.

Mission: To provide cross-country bus services and other related works to achieve the set
objectives
In order to achieve the specified objectives, WIBSE has to implement system with a proper
maintenance management system. It is found that improved maintenance helps to increase
revenues by increasing vehicle performance and eventually the economic performance of the
firm. Most importantly, firms must align the maintenance objective with firm’ s other
objectives to maximize results as plans and goals of the whole firm will be directed in the
same direction. Further more implementation of improved maintenance system needs top
management commitment. Due to lack of well established maintenance management and
other reasons, which are beyond the scope of this thesis the enterprise is subjected to
accumulated cumulative loss of Birr 42 million.
The problem encountered due to, improper maintenance management system practiced in
WIBSE are summarized as follows:
· Higher frequency of break down of buses (Table 3.1 & 3.3)
· High frequency of road calls due to break down, hence customer dissatisfaction
(Table 3.1 & 3.3)
· High fuel and oil consumption with a consequently of low performance (table 3.6)
· Higher than normal repairing cost
Decreasing of the equipment or vehicle expected service life is mainly caused by the
failure of major components of the vehicles, (See tables 3.2 and 3.4 for cause of failure). After
some time they become out of operation. Frequent break down, accident and lack of
preventive maintenance contributed a lot to decrease the vehicles service life. The other
problem is just fixing or replacing the failed parts in the vehicle with out considering related
parts. This is one of the causes of higher break down frequency. The absence of good
maintenance management is evidenced in the following:
· Higher down time of vehicles, higher operating cost and low revenue, hence low
profit (Appendix- B)
· More vehicles are in poor and bad condition (table 3.7)
· Difficult to forecast spare parts requirement as a result of more down time due to
stock out (table 3.5)
· High lead time to repair and too many obsolete vehicles
30
In order to avoid the prevailing problems due to poor and in efficient management of fleet
and spare parts, it is necessary to establish appropriate maintenance management system.
Furthermore since no equipment or vehicle is lasting forever, a replacement plan of vehicles
and equipments should be implemented parallel to proper maintenance of vehicles at hand.
The other reason widely known by technical personnel but over looked by managers is
driver’ s contribution to vehicle condition. If a vehicle is driven unwisely, no matter how it is
new, its service life is shortening rapidly. So drivers should be trained to on the consequence
of improper driving. Furthermore drivers are responsible for minor maintenance.
Therefore in order the enterprise to survive in the market the problems have to solve and for
this it is necessary to establish an effective and efficient maintenance management system.
The thesis objective originates from such clearly observed facts.

3.3 Walia Intercity Bus Service Enterprise vehicles status
Due to traditional documentation and reporting system of vehicles history, it is difficult to
conduct a detailed analysis of vehicles status. The maintenance department of WIBSE has
no record showing status of vehicles. Vehicles status can be easily identified if planned
maintenance is implemented or performance testing of engines is taken place. But here the
type of maintenance taking place is break down and minor lube therefore status of vehicles
is drawn from operational condition of the vehicles taken from 1998 report and plan of
1999. Accordingly the status is as follows:
36
Table3. 7 Quantity and status of equipments and vehicles in WIBSE
S.No Description Status and Quantity
Good Fair Poor Bad TOTAL
1 Mercedes 26 21 18 40 105
2 DAF 14 8 22 18 62
3 Fiat 2 - 4 11 17
Total 42 29 44 69 184
Percentage 22.8% 15.8% 23.9% 37.5% 100
The vehicles, which are operable and are ranked in the top in revenue and lower frequency
of breakdown, are categorized as good. Normally new and well-maintained vehicles are
classified in this category. These vehicles are earned reasonable income within the poor
maintenance management system, had they maintained preventively better performance
could be recorded. The vehicles, which are operable and out of operation that required minor
repair and easily recoverable (those vehicles which are operable but with higher repair cost
due to high frequency of break down and lower revenue) are classified as fair. These
vehicles can be maintained and corrected by minimum cost and low technical complexity.
The main problem is lack of preventive maintenance and management. Those vehicles that
are operable and out of operations that require major repair and overhaul (vehicles which are
out of operation awaiting major over haul) are categorized as poor. These vehicles need
thorough and accurate cost estimation before major overhaul to ensure that the annualized
repair and other cost in the remaining service life does not exceed depreciation and costs of
new vehicle. The remaining vehicles, which are out of operation (These vehicles are out of
operation for years and subjected to sun and rain), can be categorized in bad status. It is not
economical to repair these vehicles; definitely the cost of repair will exceed 60% of the cost
of new vehicle, therefore it is better to sell these bad status vehicles. From these buses the
enterprise plans to sell 19 of them at estimated salvage value of 78,000 Birr each and 7 small
cars at estimated value of 35,000 Birr. The remaining vehicles which can not sell may use
for spare parts by cannibalization wherever possible. Proper categorization of vehicles in
different status helps to provide cost effective maintenance work. The enterprise should
identify the vehicles status thoroughly in a regular way. Designing and implementation of
disposal system is also an issue to be addressed by WIBSE vehicles management system.
37
Due to lack of disposal system more vehicles are stopped out of service for years against sun
and rain, hence depreciated.
From the status list it is clearly seen that there is a problem of maintenance management
system. This is observed in high percentage of vehicles in poor and bad status, which
exposes to higher cost due to its maintenance complexity and higher down time.
3.4 Competition analysis
There are thirteen transport associations consisting of 1085 buses engaged in cross-country
road transportation service. The federal road transport authority controls the tariff and route
distributions.
All concerned associations are prepared and report availability of their buses to the
authority, then based on the number of buses, route is distributed fairly, “ the more
technically fit buses a company has the more routes is assigned to it” . Further more route
distribution is based on the consideration of road conditions i.e. buses serving in uncivilized
road will shift to asphalt road and vice versa in the next allocation. In case the assigned
buses are absent due to some reasons, reserves or buses with shortage of passengers are
reassigned. If a bus does not operate for a month, it could not include in the next month
route allocation.

When bus comes out of maintenance, it will be a reserve and included in the next months
route allotment. Route allocation is starts at every 17th day of a month. After the road
transport authority route distribution is announced, the operation department of WIBSE
takes its part and sends the buses to technical department once again for inspections and
checkup. The technique department prepares the buses for the required route. This time the
monthly routes available are 125 long distance, 34 medium distance, 6 short distance and 51
rotations. Let’ s have a look (table 3.9) at route coverage condition.
38

Coverage in
%
1997 5,579 3,505 2,074 63%
1998 4,792 2,784 1874 58%
In 1998 the market loss due to uncovered routes is above Birr 8,531,999 this is because of
shortage of vehicles due to down time and road break down, hence in efficient in
maintenance (PM). Further more if we see in the data in (table 3.9) above 37% of allotted
route is not covered. This shows poor quality of maintenance work done, because from the
very beginning route is assigned according to the report of technically fitted vehicles a
company has. The market share of WIBSE in 1998 is 6.7% only, which is low, and this
share is covered only 58% with own buses. Therefore WIBSE top management should give
more focus on the maintenance management system otherwise continuing in the current
manner could result in financial collapse.
Table below shows how the operation revenue is decreasing due to in efficient maintenance.

1995 8.8 35.8 41.5
1998 10 52 55
As it can be seen that revenue is decreasing whereas expenses are increasing, this shows
excess employee and decreasing maintenance efficiency. From past three years record the
availability of buses has been only 57%. Further more it is rapidly decreasing at alarming
rate.

39
In 1995 with average of 4% price increment, 16% more KM covered and transporting
passengers 21% more than 1994; however the company uses less oil and lubricant. This
shows either resources are abused or used simply without propercontrol.
3.5 Disposal and replacement plan
Walia intercity bus service enterprise has no set/stated replacement plan as well as disposal
system. Due to lack of scrap policy there are 79 buses stopped out of service for a long time
against sun, rain and other natural degrading factors (See table 3.12 for age of vehicles). If a
vehicle is not economical to repair for operation, it should be sold or disassemble for spare
parts on time.

During the last 12 years, the enterprise did not buy any bus but above half of the current
vehicles are either completely stopped or operating with difficulties. WIBSE has to have a
replacement plan to sustain its survival and competency in the sector. It is quite sure that
with the current status of vehicles and maintenance system it is not possible to be profitable
and competent. So that, in parallel to the implementation of improved maintenance
management system, the old vehicles should be soled and replaced step by step. The
replacement plan should include the following factors:
- The economic life of a vehicle; - Purchased year and current status;
- Frequency of repair due to breakdown and downtime
The replacement plan should also consider the operation and maintenance plan to be
implemented, available routes and future trends of the transport sector etc. There may be
two options either few quality vehicles with higher efficiency and low maintainability and
hence higher profit per bus for short time or higher maintainability vehicles, which can have
reasonable profit for long time by maintaining as per the recommendation of the
40
manufacture. Forecasting future needs based only on past trend has its own limitation.
Therefore, forecasting should include the following factors:
a. The capacity of overall company-in maintenance, operation and others. The capacity
should determine based on the vision, mission and objective of the enterprise.
b. Availability of current routes and the future trends of road transportation- This
includes available routes; future expected routes, trend and expected quality of passengers
service, road condition and competitors strength and weakness etc.
c. Variation of operation-the development of technology from time to time resulted in easy
and safer operation of equipment and vehicle. Nowadays there are comfortable buses with
better speed and safety, so if the current system of route distribution by government is
completely changed to free market, there is no means for passengers to use old and
uncomfortable buses especially for long distances.
d. Requirement of manpower training-depending on the new coming vehicles/equipments
and the technology employed on their manufacturing, there is some variation in operation,
maintenance and safety improvement from time to time. To use the newly purchased
equipment/vehicle properly, it is mandatory to plan why, where, and how to train the
technicians and drivers/operators who are going to operate and maintain them. The current
manpower distribution (table 3.13) shows most of the manpower in the enterprise are at low
education level.

Most of the technical personnel are working for more than 20 years with out scheduled
training, hence they are solely depending on their experience, and this contributes a lot to the
lower maintenance efficiency of the department. Furthermore, since there is no performance
measure for incentives and promotion, technicians are working to cover the working hours
41
without any consideration of maintenance quality. These reveals in high maintenance
frequency and road break down of vehicles. There are excess workers; the enterprise should
examine the overall requirement of manpower in quantity and skill.
5. Work shop and spare parts planning-the capacity of workshops and spare parts
requirement should be included in the replacement plan. The tools needed for maintenance
and training in composition and quantity shall be purchased with the vehicle/equipments.
6. Life cycle cost-life cycle cost is the total cost incurred during the actual life of the
product. Hence life cycle cost includes the acquisition cost as well as future cost for
operating and support of the product until it is finally discarded. Therefore, it is useful to
include the concepts of life cycle costing in vehicle replacement plan to compare different
alternative products and to adopt maintenance and support staffing.
3.6 Vehicle makes of WIBSE
The different makes and types of WIBSE, vehicles are presented on the table below
Table3. 14 Makes and models of WIBSE
S.No Equipment type Make
1 Transport bus Mercedes
2 Transport bus DAF
3 Transport bus Fiat
4 Support vehicle Ford
5 Support vehicle Toyota
6 Support vehicle Isuzu
7 Support vehicle Suzuki
8 Support vehicle Mercedes
As one can see from the table there are few varieties of brands of vehicles types. There are
three main vehicle makes for buses. Furthermore, theses vehicles have similar systems and
components. WIBSE has an advantage to exploit the few varies of vehicles by having few
specialized technical personnel. In the case of more varieties, each vehicle composed of
different systems and components require different specifications to operate and maintain,
hence more technical personnel or with multi skill personnel are required. To maintain these
vehicles, it requires either to have a few well trained and experienced technical personnel, or
an equivalent number of technical personnel who are capable, skillful and well trained so as
to operate and maintain them.
42
Having a few trained technical personnel is a system developed by which similar
system and components in different equipments makes and brands are maintained and
operated by single technical personnel. In this maintenance strategy, a technician who can
make trouble shooting and maintain an electrical system of DAF buses should also inspect
and maintain Mercedes, Fiat and so on. This strategy requires excessive training to upgrade
the technical capacity of the technical and operators in order to cop up with the technology
employed in the imported equipment operation and maintenance.
The other alternative is to have number of technical personnel that matches with
existing brands. In this case, each vehicle makes have their own respective specialized
technician who can operate and maintain different components and systems. This
maintenance strategy needs relatively more number of technicians and operator for each
equipment brands, which causes higher maintenance labor, training and overheads.
From the above assessments made on the existing system of WIBSE it is found out that none
of the alternatives stated above are employed. The enterprise has excess technicians and
other workers but no proper management and training to maintain the fleets effectively and
efficiently that is why the costs related to salary is increasing while operation revenue is
decreasing (see table 3.10). For all these problems the decision and solution is expected from
the management. Due to poor maintenance management all profitable and non-profitable
buses are repaired without any priority hence high owning cost is revealed. Owning cost is
the cost of incurred for the purchase and possession. Owning cost consists of depreciation
cost, interest, insurance and taxes (table3.15). Therefore, it is strongly recommended that
WIBSE should device a mechanism by which it can hire and retain a few multi skilled
technical personnel, who can maintain the existing equipment and vehicles.
Table3. 15 Income statements for the year 1998 budget year In 1000
Description 1998 Total Continued

43
Besides, it should train technical personnel and supervisors to equip them with sufficient
skills to develop and apply effective maintenance system. For the first and foremost
management guidance and monitoring is compulsory. This helps WIBSE to utilize the
vehicles to the required capacity. In general, having few multi-skilled technical personnel,
few brands (makes) of vehicles and equipments enable the enterprise in developing low cost
of operation, maintenance and down time.
3.7 Vehicle maintenance management system
As one can understand from the past brief explanation regarding vehicle status, WIBSE face
a problem of maintenance systematization. This was revealed by high percentage of bad and
poor status of vehicles owned by WIBSE. The higher percentage of bad and poor status of
fleet resulted in large owning cost and down time cost, hence no profit but continuously loss
that attributed to lack of proper maintenance management system.
The existing maintenance of WIBSE mainly can be categorized in to the following
two types:
Break down maintenance-as the topic indicates, breakdown maintenance is the system in
which equipment/vehicle is run or operated until breakdown. This is one of the main types
of maintenance system practiced in WIBSE. The main causes of the implementation of
breakdown maintenance system in the enterprise are:
· Lack of company wide vision ,hence lack of strategic plan in long term
· Lack of proper maintenance management system
· Lack of training as well as commitment of all employees
· Lack of sufficient budget to purchase necessary spare parts for periodically
maintenance and service
· Lack of information:
¾ The reasons for the break down, since no record analysis
¾ How to carry out the repairs
¾ How to acquire the spares
¾ Who is qualified enough to undertake the repair
¾ The exact fund from which payment has to be made for these works.
· Unpredictability of failures of components
44
· Gradual wear and tear of parts, which can be eliminated to a large extent by regular
inspection known as preventive maintenance.
Minor lubrication change maintenance program ( lube maintenance)-Minor lubrication
maintenance program includes the tasks of changing hydraulic oil engine oil, differential oil,
brake fluid, oil filters, belts, air cleaners and greasing of components. It is the second type of
maintenance system practiced by the enterprise. In this case, vehicles are not overhauled
until it breaks down, except that with the lubrication change program in which it takes
longer for the vehicle to break down. This is regularly practiced only for some time, and
then slowly fades. After some time, things are forgotten and the attention for the routine
lubrication program is missed. Workers are not interested in periodic maintenance as a
whole and management is not considered PM as basic principle furthermore top
management considers that maintenance is departments’ task. Consequently, due to
improper maintenance systems prevailing in WIBSE, the vehicles minor lubrications change
programs are taken place with the break down maintenance system.
The disadvantage of existing system of WIBSE is that they are mainly conducted at higher
cost and more downtime.
These are mainly composed of:
(a) Higher owning cost due to short service life of vehicles
(b) Higher operating costs which is caused by
¾ Excessive fuel consumption and lubrication
¾ Frequent repairs due to breakdown
(c) Higher vehicle downtime cost due to low availability
(d) Shortage of manpower to conduct preventive maintenance due to more breakdown jobs
(e) More road break down, hence, higher maintenance cost and loss of customer satisfaction,
cost for assigning another bus.
(f) Higher spare part consumption
Overhaul: - In WIBSE over hauling is taking place after a vehicle is disabled due to higher
frequency of breakdown and performed without thorough estimation of costs with respect to
the expected service.
Having evaluated the existing maintenance systems as well as their cause and effects,
it is strongly recommended that WIBSE must develop effective and proper vehicle
45
maintenance management system. It is necessary to train the maintenance personnel and
inspectors/planners to understand the use and advantages of preventive maintenance,
maintenance planning and scheduling. Management is responsible for changing the existing
system in to proper and effective maintenance system and continuously monitored.
3.8 Situation of planning and control system
The existing maintenance practices are breakdown and minor lube. In the absence of
PM it is too difficult to control and plan activities properly. Thus, it is compulsory to
consider the problems of maintenance planning and control system with the prevailing
situation of maintenance management system. The improvement of maintenance
management system of WIBSE should be in planning, control and analysis of maintenance
costs such as, labor cost, spare parts cost, fuel and lubricant and others. Maintenance
planning requires forecasting of inspection time, repair schedules, manpower and spare parts
requirements. Maintenance works can be forecasted, if vehicle/equipments are included in
preventive manner. Various manufacturers recommend inspection programs with fixed time
replacement and cleaning of fast moving items such as filters, seals, air cleaners etc. and
conditioned based replacement of other inspected parts. These program also include tasks
such as cleaning, lubricating, adjusting and have to be carried out in definite mileage or
operating hours. When preventive maintenance is institutionalized, the program can be
corrected in to plans. The planning task will also include forecasting spare parts and
manpower requirement.
3.9 Situation of Spare parts
Since the existing system is almost breakdown and minor lube change program, it is obvious
that there is no effective and efficient way of spare parts planning and control system. It was
seen in table 3.5 that many vehicles are idle the whole month waiting for spare parts. Further
more spare parts are purchased depending on budget without requirement forecasts; hence
money is waste on dead stock. The requisition is prepared for the need of spare parts by
break down maintenance and lubrication change. The other main problem is purchasing of
non-genuine parts, this causes higher frequency of breakdown. No reliable and regular
suppliers are available. There are also large amounts of dead stock in store because of
46
mismatch between requirement and the purchased item. The main cause of this problem is
improper materials
Table3. 16 Wrongly purchased spare parts and unused as per the requirement
Year purchased purchased spare parts and available in stock (unused)
Transfer to Amount (Birr) Total
Before 1997 1997 4,559,634

1998 1999 1,311,277
6,309,271
requirement planning (see table 3.16). For example Birr 6,309,271 is tied due to wrong spare
parts purchased, this is because spare parts are bought in bulk based on the budget. On the
other hand above 50% of vehicles down time is caused by shortage of spare parts. This
shows lack of coordination between supply and maintenance departments. Since we have
said that there is low management concerns, corrective action is not been taken on time in
the maintenance department rather continues to the current worse situation.
3.10 Work shop capacities
WIBSE has a main workshop in Lideta with estimated area of 20,000 meter square this
accommodates the main office of the enterprise and all maintenance activities; 52,000
square meters and a book value of 960,000 Birr Diabako depots in Keira. Lideta workshop is
the main one, which provide for all maintenance activities including major overhaul. This
compound includes the main office of the enterprise. There is also 2500 square meter in
Shashemane town built for workshop and dispatching office purpose by expending above
100,000 Birr but, it is idle without service. This time Diabako depot is used for major
overhauls and parking of in-operable buses and parking lot for out side companies. There are
no regular workers assigned here but when major over haul is to be taking place workers are
assigned.
Rebuilding works of the enterprise is outsourced to Anbesa city bus service; Akaki spar
parts Share Company and Ambo machine shop. When components need to be rebuild, it
takes more time. This problem can be solved either providing the facility in the enterprise
itself or by having long term contract with reliable partner.
The workshop main activities include:-Painting, tyre repair, electrical repair, body and
chassis, engine and gearbox, running gear repair, top and major overhaul etc. It is simple to
47
say all maintenance activities except rebuilding of components such as grinding of
crankshaft, valve seat re-facing, cylinder head re-facing ,and cylinder re-boring etc. are
done in-house.
3.10.1 Workshop facilities
In organizations that are engaged in road transportation like WIBSE, the importance of
sufficient workshop is inevitable. In this aspect WIBSE has sufficient workshop area with
proper ventilation and light intensity, but the problem is, the shops are not well organized.
Cabinets and benches are not provided; consequently components are put in the floor
improperly. Some of the sections such as engine and gearbox repair, painting and others
look like stores of obsolete items due to improper cleanness, hence low working atmosphere.
Tools and parts are not properly kept in toolbox but everywhere dispersed. This is also cause
safety problems and waste of time to find tools and parts. Cranes and pulleys are old and
with out proper safety. Now it is better to purchase hydraulic jacks and modern lifting
equipments.
Generally even if there is sufficient workshop area, shop organization and tool handling is
very poor, hence, great attention is required.
Store:-there is one main store for stocking spare parts under the supply department. In the
store there are spare parts and stationery items. Spare parts are stored in-group and
according to part number. The group identifies to which type of spare is belonging i.e. DAF,
Mercedes, Fiat, Small cars, and workshop equipment or stationery items. Under each group
parts are stored in part number. Store keeping and arrangement is good because these are
also kept in shelves and parts number. In addition to the part number it is recommended to
put spare parts in alphabetical order to facilitate easy finding of parts with out wasting time.
Cycle counting of Spare parts is every year, but it is recommended to be in half a year base
Having presented the existing situation of workshops, equipments and tools of
WIBSE, the following comments and recommendations are made:
· There are sufficient workshop equipment and machinery to assist the current
maintenance and repair activities. But it is observed that the equipment and
machinery are very old and working beyond their service life, this influences the
quality of maintenance and efficiency of technical personnel. Therefore it is
48
recommended to purchase new and precise equipments and hand tools with in the
budget provided year by year.
· Since preventive maintenance is taken as a main means to solve the maintenance
problems, it is necessary to purchase equipments and tools, which help to
accomplish preventive maintenance. Specially to know vehicles status, it is better to
have engine diagnostic and performance testing equipments or provide this in
contract base taking either of the economical one.
· Due to absence of special tools and testing instruments in the shop of WIBSE,
conditions of vehicles are not properly monitored, as a result higher frequency of
breakdown maintenance are occurred. Service shops with no special tools like
WIBSE, there are events that parts are broken unnecessarily, burnt or struck by a
large hammer, which may decrease hardness or deform, increase charge of exchange
parts during disassembling. In similar manner there is unstable tensioning or fittings,
causing imperfect and expensive services at the time of assembling. This cannot be
avoided even with skilled technicians in the absence of proper tools and equipments.
These are main problems that WIBSE currently facing. So it is recommended to
equip the workshops with modern equipments and tools.
The existing situation of WIBSE can be concluded as compared to Basic principles of
transportation service

CHAPTER 4: STANDARDIZATION AND CODIFICATION
4.1. Application of standardization
Standardization is briefly described as grouping of similar equipments and vehicles
according to their application, model or size [2].
Categorization of equipments and vehicles by their application (duties) are the major classes
in which equipment of similar function are grouped together. In the case of WIBSE the
revenue buses are grouped in one category and the supporting light vehicles in another
category. In the same way the remaining workshop equipments and tools are grouped in
their respective category. Further classification of WIBSE’ s vehicles can be conducted
depending on their make and model to suit for maintenance and spare parts planning. The
classification of size based on weight, power of engine, passenger carrying capacity (seats)
and some other engineering measures are some of the bases for vehicles and equipments
standardization. Thus, the categorization of equipments/vehicles in to sub-classes that helps
to utilize the same parts and subassemblies are one of the final goals of standardizing system
development.
As we have seen, the vehicles can be classified as for their purpose, makes, models
and duties. It could be Mercedes, Fiat, DAF, small cars and workshop equipment and tools.
Since there are few varieties of vehicles, standardization is not a big problem for WIBSE,
but it is wise to understand that coding is even more facilitating. In this section the factors
that should be considered in establishing the system and the merit of its effective and
efficient applications are to be forwarded.
Having excessive brands, models and makes needs:
¾ More budget to purchase and supply spare parts
¾ More number of technicians/higher multi-skilled
¾ Higher efficiency in maintenance management system
¾ Difficulty to have more sufficient suppliers of spares parts
From the current situation, it was observed that there is no big problem due to excessive
variety of vehicles or equipments.
Excessive variety and lack of standardization creates the following problems:
¾ Larger downtime due to waiting for spare part
50
¾ Larger lead time of spare orders
¾ Higher maintenance cost due to small lot size of spare parts
¾ Higher paper works to order parts
¾ Higher number of deadline equipment/vehicle that are waiting for repair and spare
parts supply
¾ Higher investment cost
¾ Higher stock value
¾ Higher lead time of spare orders etc.
· In order to minimize such problems, it is necessary to develop and implement good
standardization.
4.2 Economic benefits of standardization
The economic benefits gained through establishing and implementing standardization
system are presented below:
Reduction in the investment of equipment and spare parts: when equipment and vehicles
are closed related by good standardization, it is possible to reduce investment costs.
Investment cost reduction is obtained by holding lower stock values of spare parts that can
be utilized to minimum down time cost.
Cheaper and less difficult to adequate supply of spare parts: standardization helps to
reduce the paper work to order and purchase parts. Due to fewer values of stored parts and
subassemblies while effective standardization system is developed and carrying cost is
undoubtedly reduced.
Small stock values of subassemblies and repair kits to be stored: when well-organized and
good equipment standardization system is developed, it is possible that parts and repair kits
are commonly utilized. This helps to store minimum stock values of parts and subassemblies
that may be stored if the owned equipment varies in size, model and make that cannot
utilized parts commonly.
Lower maintenance cost: when owned equipment/vehicles are closely related, the
technician will maintain similar equipments and vehicles and become specialized in repairs
as well as in trouble shooting. Thus, standardization aids to lower training cost than when
equipment and vehicles varies in size, make and model.
51
Lower operating cost: when equipment and vehicles are closely related in size, make and
model, it is easier to replace operators in case of illness, absence or retirement. Thus,
effective and efficient standardization resulted in lower training of operators and overhead
cost. But due to lack of maintenance management system WIBSE did not use such
advantages. Even though WIBSE has no several verities of vehicles, standardizing the
existing system will benefit now and in the future. Further it remedies some of the problems
in maintenance management system.
Hence, it is recommended that WIBSE should develop a good standardization system based
on their:
· Application,
· Make, size and
· Function
· Model
This can undoubtedly contribute to minimize the existing problems of maintenance
management system.
4.3 Codification and its application
Equipment codification: equipment codification is a systematic grouping of
equipment/vehicles in WIBSE to give particular identification. In the enterprise, even if
there are few varieties of equipment and vehicles with limited makes, purpose, model and
size, it is very important to develop codification. There are various systems of codification
that can be adopted. Numerical as well as alphabetical codes can be used for the purpose of
identification of different items.
The main objectives of codification can be stated as follows:
¾ To control expenses at source. This can be obtained by developing an
identical number in such a way that all costs are recorded on the bases of
particular identification number given to each vehicles;
¾ To control the duplication of parts
¾ To control and supervise maintenance
¾ To assist in equipment and vehicle standardization
¾ To identify easily the equipments or vehicles owned by WIBSE and
¾ To facilitate computerization of maintenance management.
52
4.3.1 Application of codification in WIBSE
WIBSE has tried to establish codification system for types of failure, repair classes, types of
lubrication and others (See table 4.1). This codification is numerically assigned to systems,
failure types, work accomplished and type of oils. But they did not codify vehicles/
equipments, office and stationery items.

A codification system that takes in to consideration the location of equipment/vehicle, its
class and sub-class is recommended to benefit from the objectives of codification. The
coding is presented in the following tables.
Table4. 2 Proposed Departmental codes (location)
Code Assigned departments/ office

2 Heavy duty vehicles( buses)
3 Workshop equipments
4 Office facilities and utilities
5 Workshop tools
6 Spare parts
In the proposed codification system, the code recommended to represent equipment/vehicle/
sub-classes follows the code assigned to main classes. Equipment/ vehicles having the same
equipment main class are supposed to have similar functions. Therefore, it can be applicable
to adopt similar maintenance plan or cycles depending on manufacturer recommendations,
working conditions and age for the equipment/vehicle categorized in the same main class.
This simplifies the task of maintenance activities. Besides, maintenance planning and
control activities can be easily done by computer
In addition to the above advantages, WIBSE can easily identify the equipment/ vehicle/ to
order parts and hold in stock by the aid of the code assigned to subclasses. The vehicles and
equipment subclasses and their code shall be presented as under:
54
Table4. 4 Codification of sub-classes
Code Assigned sub-classes

32 Work shop equipments
41 Office furniture
42 Stationery equipments
43 Communication items
50 Workshop tools
61 Mercedes spare
62 DAF spare
63 Fiat spare
64 Light vehicles spare
In the designation the first digit represents the enterprise asset, second departmental
location; the third digit stands for main class and the forth one represent sub-class
classifications. The remaining is for identification number.
Example1: W1-11(234) represents: W-walia intercity bus service property (asset); 1-belong
to the maintenance department; 1-supporting light vehicle 1-pickup single cabin; 234-
identification number
Example 2: W0-22 4055- In this case W- walia intercity bus asset; 0-belongs to the
enterprise; 2-heavy duty vehicle (bus) 2-DAF; 4055 bus number (identification number)
Spare parts for light vehicle can be further classified in model of car and this is left for the
department to code in suitable manner.
For the preventive maintenance proposed in this thesis, corresponding codes are proposed in

CHAPTER 5: DESIGN OF VEHICLE PREVENTIVE
MAINTENANCE
Preventive maintenance is a must for all equipment and passenger-carrying vehicles are no
exception. A strict maintenance and inspection program is as necessary as fuel in the tank, if
the vehicle is expected to provide dependable service. Properly maintained equipment last
longer, cost less to operate, is involved in fewer accidents and provides more trouble-free
service. Effective preventive maintenance (PM) services must be performed repeatedly as
governed by preventive maintenance intervals and schedules.
5.1 Maintenance planning and control system
It was observed that maintenance planning and control system was not developed and
practiced so as to utilize the existing vehicles in proper manner. For the effective and
efficient implementation of preventive maintenance system, it is mandatory to plan,
schedule and control every maintenance activity done in the enterprise. Planning scheduling
and controlling preventive maintenance activities are the basis for increased maintenance
productivity and motivating the maintenance workers. Here it should be noted that there are
other problems beyond the scope of this thesis, which needed further studies.
5.1.1 Maintenance planning
Planning is the determination of all necessary elements required to perform a task in
advance of the job start time. It is the heart of good inspection and preventive maintenance;
therefore, it is necessary for the maintenance personnel to know the volume of task to be
performed by the equipment/vehicle each year, month, week and day in order to plan true
preventive maintenance. This helps the maintenance personnel to identify the time when the
vehicle is free to under take maintenance. Thus, the cooperation and coordination of
operation department with the maintenance department including supplies department is the
key for the successful performance of planed maintenance. The requirement of maintenance
planning emanates from the fact that planned activities are more cost effective than
unplanned maintenance.
In order to plan and schedule good preventive maintenance system, the following factors
have to be analyzed and considered:
· Availability of required materials and stores information;
57
· Availability of technical personnel
· Age of vehicles and /or equipments;
· Availability of necessary tools;
· Vehicle and equipment history
· Working environment or condition;
· Manufacturers recommendation;
· Criticality of vehicles and/or equipment;
· Type of training and/or skill manpower to assist maintenance
· The task performed by the vehicle related to time
· Quality of fuels and lubricant used
· Budget allocation.
In addition to the above factors, it is necessary to discuss the objectives of preventive
maintenance with the management to get valuable support for the successful
accomplishment of the plan. This enables the management to institutionalize preventive
maintenance policy and provide necessary support in releasing budget resources
requirements.
The devotion and dedication of maintenance personnel and the supporting staff are the main
factors for the successful accomplishment of planed maintenance. Understanding of the
objectives and methods to be applied while PM is conducted can assist the development of
effective maintenance plan.
From the current practice in WIBSE, it is very difficult to obtain vehicle history for the
purpose of planning preventive maintenance, this is because the history is simply a recorded
of what was repaired, replaced in breakdown maintenance. Most of the records available are
kept for the sake of report not for maintenance improvement or for later use .To start with
preventive maintenance through investigation and performance testing of each vehicle have
to taken place then after set the preventive maintenance program depending on:
· Manufacturer recommendation;
· Status and age of the vehicle
· Working condition;
· Criticality of the component of
vehicle.
-Assign places at which maintenance can be performed alternatively:
· Own workshop · Dealers workshop
58
· Private workshop · Field service with mobile
workshop
-Time when maintenance is to be taken place
Availability of technicians for the maintenance work:
· Required tools and instruments
· Required materials,
· Required safety;
· Maintenance procedure
· Standard repair time
· Accurate store information;
Based on the above factors and the existing realities, maintenance plan of WIBSE’ s vehicles
and equipments can be developed from their PM programs and maintenance cycles. Each
equipment or vehicle has its own specific maintenance programs adopted from manufacturer
recommendation. However, in order to simplify the paper work and minimize the time
required to prepare each maintenance program for each vehicle, it is necessary to
standardize maintenance programs for vehicle or equipments that are in the same category.
One of the benefits obtained when effective standardization is established is that
maintenance programs and planning will be simplified. In the following sections
maintenance programs of categories of vehicles is presented.
5.1.1.1 Maintenance programs of vehicles
Maintenance programs are as an input for preparation of maintenance plan. Maintenance
program is the set of maintenance activities that are planned to be accomplished in a definite
interval. Each maintenance program is based on the following factors:
· Manufacture recommendations based on service life of major components;
· Operation conditions.
· Age of the vehicle/equipment;
· Criticality of vehicle or equipment;
· Quality of lubricant and fuel applied;
· Maintenance history of vehicle or reported data;
Although, it is impossible to present exhaustively all activities conducted during each
maintenance programs, only the major tasks that should be performed on all equipment and
59
vehicles of the same category are proposed. The information presented for different
maintenance programs are compiled and organized from various manufactures operation
manuals, discussions held with senior technicians and drivers, and the realities currently
observed in WIBSE. For effective and efficient accomplishment of PM program in the
enterprise, the inspectors/planners should identify all activities that are required during a
particular PM program and write down on accompanying sheet of workshop repair order.
a) Daily inspection:-it is necessary to conduct daily inspection on each vehicle /equipment
by operator. The following general inspections shall be conducted daily:
· Steering oil (for power steering
type)
· Air pressure in tyres
· Air pressure indicator for brakes
and other accessories
· Fuel, coolant levels
· Crankcase oil level (both before
and after starting of operation)
· Leakage and cracks
· Belt tension
· Loosen bolts and nuts
· Safety items (brakes, lights,
horns), etc.
· Greasing or lubricating of some
functional components as required
· Brake and clutch fluid
· Hydraulic fluid level
· Checking battery cables
· Checking of windshield washer
fluid level
· Checking of cab tilt locking
· Checking of instrument panel
· Checking of wheel nut tightness
· Transmission case oil level
· Cleaning and adjusting of
functional components as required
In order to implement daily in section it is necessary to train drivers and prepare instructions
in Amharic. Daily inspection is the base for PM development in any industry using vehicles
and equipments
b) Maintenance program for light duty vehicles (small vehicles), Main class: 1
As it was explain in the previous sections, light vehicles are categorized under vehicles main
class (1).
60
Although the type of maintenance programs and their frequency depends on manufacturer
recommendations, the type of vehicle/equipment and working conditions, the following
general maintenance programs are recommended to be established and conducted in WIBSE
for vehicles categorized in (1)main class.
i) Maintenance program one for light duty (MP1-LV)
Although the intervals at which the type of maintenance is conducted vary with
manufacturing recommendation, working conditions, age, etc., it is supposed to be
conducted at every 4000 kilometers or two and half months whichever comes first.
MP1-LV includes:
· All activities which are recommended to be accomplished in daily inspection; and
· Checking battery electrolyte level;
· Checking operation of starting/
changing circuits;

steering tie rod ends.
iV) Partial over haul (MP4-LV)
This type of preventive maintenance program is supposed to be conducted every 50 months
(4 year and two months) or at 80,000 kilometers whichever comes first based on vehicle
condition. The type of maintenance prolongs the service life of the engine before conducting
full overhaul. In order to implement this type of maintenance program, it is compulsory to
inspect the vehicles engine performance and analyze or evaluate vehicles repair history. The
activities accomplished during partial overhaul include:
· All activities performed during MP3-LV; and
· Facing valves seats;
· Changing valve seats;
· Changing valve guide (after
inspection and if necessary)
· Changing head gaskets;
· Changing piston rings;
· Changing connecting rod bearings;
· Cleaning combustion chamber;
· Facing cylinder head (if necessary)
· Changing timing belt (depending
on manufacturer instruction)
V) Full over haul (MP5-LV)
This type of maintenance takes place in order to upgrade the vehicles’ engine performance
deteriorated due to longer service life. The maintenance activities accomplished during
MP4-LV include complete engine overhaul and rebuilding of deteriorated parts. It is
62
supposed to be conducted at every 160,000 kilometers or 8-9 year, depending on the vehicle
conditions.
The activities accomplished during full over haul of vehicles include:
· All activities performed during MP4- LV; and
· Changing piston assembly
· Re-boring or changing the liner, if
necessary;

synchronizers, if necessary;
· Overhaul of fuel injection pump;
· Checking and overhauling of
differential gear;
· Checking and overhauling steering
gear and linkages
c) Maintenance program for heavy-duty vehicles, Main class: 2
Heavy-duty vehicle refers to buses of WIBSE, which are a combination of 62 seats of
Mercedes, DAF, and Fiat buses.
The code for these buses is M stands for Mercedes, F for Fiat and D for DAF. Even if the
makes and models of these vehicles is different, it is possible to give general maintenance
program which can slightly modified according to manufacturers recommendation.

d) Maintenance program for workshop equipments
This type of maintenance refers to the garage equipments, machines and instruments. This
can be extracted from the respective manuals and manufacturer’ s recommendation. The
preventive maintenance for these equipments is prepared based on the operation hours. This
is left to be prepared by the maintenance department in the same manner as the vehicles
maintenance programs.
5.1.2 Maintenance scheduling
Maintenance schedules are prepared for preventive maintenance activities. It is the
sequential arrangements by which maintenance is going to be conducted. In general,
maintenance scheduling comprises the task to be performed, when to be performed? Where
to be performed? Who will perform the task? And the required resources and estimated
completion time. The schedule consists of vehicle number and the date of inspection and
estimated completion time.
Preparation of maintenance scheduling requires an experienced planner who can put every
maintenance activities according to their chronological order, decide required human and
material resources and estimate completion time of the activities. Therefore, for the
successful accomplishment of PM in WIBSE, it is mandatory to establish maintenance
scheduling procedure.
The craft worker’ s staffing should be determined strictly by the backlog of work for each
craft. Craft backlog is the amount of work that is documented as needing to be performed by
the craft. The work that is counted in the backlog is only the work that is ready to schedule
or that can be performed at present time. The formula to calculate the backlog is as follows:
True craft capacity
Total planned hours readyto schedule
Back log (inweeks) =
The true craft capacity is the total hours scheduled for the craft for a week minus scheduled
interruptions. Scheduled interruptions should include average hours spent on emergencies,
absenteeism, vacations, and routine or preventive maintenance work. This leaves the total
67
hours that the craft will actually deduct from the backlog. Illustrative example for
(permanent crew =10 and contract crew =2):
Total employee hours scheduled for next week (10 x 40 hours) = 400 hours
Total over time to be worked (average for last three months) =40 hours
Total contract labor (2x 40 hours) =80 hours
Gross labor hours available = 520 hours
Average emergency work (say 50% for the last three months) = 260 hours
Average absenteeism/week =10 hours
Average vacation hours/week =10 hours
Average routine (non backlog) hours/week =40 hours
Total deductions =320 hours
Gross minus deduction =200 hours
These 200 hours represent what can realistically be expected to be completed from backlog
work for the week. This is the number that should be used to determine the true backlog.
The calculation would be as follows (assume 2000 hours in the backlog)
Example 1 Example 2
weeks
hours

Back 3.8
520

log = = weeks

log = =
In the first example it is impossible to complete the work on the backlog given the
constraints placed on the craft time available. But in the second example 10 weeks is
required to complete the work considering scheduled interruptions and emergencies
Maintenance cycles of vehicles of LV vehicles
Each maintenance program that is conducted on each vehicle / equipment comprises
maintenance cycles of vehicles or equipments. Maintenance cycle is the maintenance types
that are taking place until full overhaul is conducted on the vehicle or equipment in
chronological order. In other words, maintenance cycle is the period between two successive
major overhauls of the vehicle or equipment. Examples on maintenance cycles of WIBSE
vehicles are presented below:
i) Maintenance cycle for Light duty (LV), Main class: 1

The time of completion of maintenance cycle is 288,000km or about five years
In similar manner it can be developed inspection intervals for garage equipments, machines
and instruments according to manufacturer recommendation and operating hours.
Determination of maintenance programs, maintenance cycles and maintenance schedules for
each vehicle or equipment simplify the task of maintenance planning. Maintenance planning
can easily be determined (derived) from maintenance programs and maintenance cycles.
Maintenance planning may be prepared for the life of the vehicle or equipment or working
budget year. WIBSE is recommended to prepare annual vehicle and equipment maintenance
plan. Annual maintenance plan has to be broken down to quarterly, monthly, weekly and
daily maintenance works to be done. The following maintenance planning samples help the
maintenance department of WIBSE to prepare and adopt their annual vehicle preventive
maintenance plan.
Vehicle main class: 1

The same thing can be developed for garage equipments and instruments. This is left for the
maintenance department to develop according to the discussed criteria.
The purpose of presenting the samples of annual maintenance plan is to assist the WIBSE’ s
maintenance department to conduct effective and efficient maintenance plan depending on
the existing situation.
Improvement of maintenance programs
Currently recommendations are forwarded to start PM programs at definite kilometers or
hours of operation mainly based on manufacturer recommendation, working conditions and
ages of the vehicles. For the future, it is also important to conduct the analysis of
composition of used lubricant in order to decrease or increase the maintenance interval
based on condition of vehicles. In a similar manner, it is possible to set the necessary
operational mileage or hours of intervals at which engine and transmission oil changing
programs are taking place.
5.1.3 Maintenance controlling
For the successful accomplishment of planned maintenance, it is necessary to establish the
mechanism by which each planned maintenance input and output activities are controlled.
72
This has to be done to check whether or not the activities performed are adhered to the
objectives set with the limited resources allotted.
Maintenance is controlled based on the following maintenance major input and out put
activities. These are;
· Cost incurred;
· Activities required;
· Performance;
· Resource utilized;
· Safety required.
a) Cost controlling: the most neglected part in maintenance activities conducted in WIBSE
is the cost incurred due to improper management and lack of top management concern in
maintenance of the buses. Drivers and operation department do not want to stop the vehicle
for preventive maintenance purpose for the sake of daily payment and short term profit
respectively. Technicians are not also willing to conduct routine maintenance rather they are
interested in break down maintenance. These cumulative problems make maintenance more
complex, more down time and maintenance costs are very high and in some vehicles total
operation revenue is less than total cost. The operation of vehicle till breakdown results
higher maintenance cost that can be minimized by implementing of preventive maintenance
system.
Major maintenance costs that can be controlled include:
-Direct maintenance cost:
· Labor cost;
· Material cost;
- Indirect cost
 Down time cost and
 Overhead cost
Cost recording and comparison system is not established at all in WIBSE. Absence of cost
recording and analyzing is the main cause that most of the enterprises vehicles are utilized in
the condition of incurring high operation and maintenance cost.
b) Controlling activities required: Most of the activities conducted in WIBSE are not
performed or forecasted by planner or skilled personnel. For this reason, it is not possible to
control the activities performed on vehicle or equipment and the time each maintenance
activity require. All maintenance activities are conducted by trial and error. Furthermore
73
once maintenance task is ordered and estimated there is no follow up and reasoning for on
time completion. The replacement of parts and repair is determined after the break down
occurred and the parts are physically checked. For this reason vehicles to be repaired will
take longer period than planned. If the parts required are not available in the stock the
problem becomes more severe. The top management complains the maintenance department
with out appropriate support. Management should give more attention to solve the problem
from its root.
In order to improve the existing problem in maintenance activities conducted in WIBSE,
establishment of preventive maintenance system is indispensable. Then, it will be possible to
control implementation of maintenance activities and set standard time for each job.
Thus, it is recommended that WIBSE should develop the mechanism by which the
maintenance activities, maintenance time and spare parts requirement are earlier
determined..
c) Performance control: we can see performance control from the technical personnel
assigned to conduct the maintenance activities and the vehicle/ equipment maintained point
of view. Lack of training and management in WIBSE resulted in low performance of
technical personnel. This can be reflected from the fact that most of the technical personnel
are not following maintenance procedures but simply by experience and old method. In
modern maintenance policy any technical personnel has to follow a certain procedure to
maintain, repair or replace parts since this increases maintenance efficiency. Procedures are
available in manuals. Proper troubleshooting is not conducted in the enterprise to identify
and rectify the problem occurred in the vehicle. The problem solving methods, maintenance
activities and procedures are determined from the experience of technical personnel who are
assigned to rectify the problem.
After the rectification of the problems identified by mechanic assigned, the maintained
vehicle will come to the garage without giving service as expected. The reliability of the
maintained vehicle to give service is the second method of evaluating maintenance
performance.
It is necessary to device a system by which the productivity and service quality of each
technician and the workshop as a whole can be evaluated. The performance indicators of the
maintenance department should include the following:
74
Maintenance costs- the greater the maintenance cost the lower the efficiency
Yearly down time- greater the down time lesser is the efficiency
Service life-greater the service life higher is the efficiency
The performance, which is cumulative of the above, should be the basis for productivity and
quality to give incentives and promotions.
d) Resource control: in WIBSE and of course in everywhere resources are limited; they
have to be controled and managed efficiently and effectively Due to lack of control of
technical personnel, tools, and materials assigned to a particular maintenance are wasted
unwisely. Therefore, it is compulsory to distribute properly and manage the available
resource of the enterprise. The effective and efficient management of resources minimizes
the cost incurred due to wastage of resources and increase maintenance productivity.
e) Safety control: safety is one of the most neglected areas that have to be controlled while
maintenance is conducted in everywhere. Due to lack of safer working areas in WIBSE,
there are enormous resources wasted and damaged. Thus, it is essential to conduct training
in the areas where safety problems are evident. Most of the shops working areas in WIBSE
are looks like traditional garages, which are not safer to conduct good maintenance work.
5.2 Maintenance workflow system
For successful accomplishment of maintenance activities, it is necessary to develop and
implement a clearly known workflow system and use different recording formats. This
simplifies the task of maintenance and enhances productivity. Due to improper maintenance
flow system the problems that are observed is as follows:
· Lack of standard formats to be used by all personnel;
· Inefficient and ineffective implementation of maintenance workflow system;
· Inadequate reporting system to department heads and managers;
· In sufficient record system;
· Lack of accurate job descriptions for each technical personnel including supervisors;
· Occurrence of frequent accidents;
· Lack of coordination between workers, department, and top management;
· In efficient maintenance work done;
· Lack of clearly identified maintenance flow;
75
· Lack of management system.
In addition to the above mentioned problems, the technical personnel and the department as
a whole did not try to work based on manuals and procedures, rather based on their
experience without any analysis of the maintenance efficiency.
In general, the existence of the above and other problems cause low productivity of
WIBSE’ s technical personnel. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that the enterprise
should develop a standard and uniform maintenance workflow system with accompanying
formats. This will help to compromise conflicting ideas during maintenance work
processing.
Maintenance activities pass through different steps and require good decision on each step.
This requires not only technical personnel but also maintenance manager to take correction
action in relation to the objectives of the enterprise. The procedures in which maintenance
activities pass should be known and controlled by the proper concerned people. Therefore,
the duties of maintenance manager, workshop supervisors, inspectors/planners, foremen,
mechanics and drivers/operators in the process of maintenance and repair have to be clearly
identified and controlled

78
Depending on the type of task to be accomplished and urgency, maintenance work request
or service may originate from drivers/operators, mechanics, workshop foremen, workshop
supervisors and operations managers. In normal working condition, drivers, supervisors,
planners and controllers can be request for preventive maintenance.
After receiving the request for service prepared by relevant personnel, the workshop
supervisor or workshop head assigned the technical personnel who can inspect the vehicle to
be maintained or repaired so as to prepare work repair order (Refer Fig 5.3 for major activities
conducted in maintenance workflow system). The inspectors are required to propose to the
workshop supervisor where maintenance can be performed. This has to be approved by the
workshop supervisor or head. The vehicles of WIBSE could be repaired or maintained in
one of the following:
· Lideta work shop
· Diabako work shop
· Field repair in the case of road break down
· Private/governmental workshops
By analyzing the job required on the work order prepared by the inspector/planner, the shop
supervisor determines where the maintenance activities have to be performed.
The task that requires special techniques beyond WIBSE’ s technical personnel capabilities
has to be sent to private workshops or contractors. These work orders have to be approved
by workshop manager confirming that the task is beyond the technical capabilities of the
maintenance department. The maintenance activities that are performed in WIBSE’ s
workshop are approved and controlled by maintenance department. Almost all of
maintenance activities are performed in the Lideta workshop and Diabako. When road break
down is reported, the driver tells operation department to take action for the passengers. The
operation department reports to the maintenance department with the type of break down
and its severity from the driver’ s point of view. Accordingly the department decides whether
the vehicle is to be repaired by sending the mechanics and materials, in private garages or to
be towed and bring to Addis Ababa for maintenance.
79
5.2.1 Request for service
Based on driver’ s request, vehicle under complaint will inspected by the technical personnel
and then request for maintenance or repair is prepared. The following information should be
provided in the request for service:
· Vehicle/ equipment;
· Vehicle identification number;
· Vehicle service meter, type
mileage or operation hours;
· The type of service or maintenance
required.
· The components to be serviced or
maintained and other necessary
information, which may assist
the service activities
The workshop head approves the request depending on the standard or conditions set for the
request type of maintenance. After approval of request for service, the maintenance clerk
prepares repair order. Table 5.3 illustrates the sample formats developed for request service.
Repair order:-The format is filled based on the information obtained from the driver/
inspector or the technical personnel verified the problem. This is a written communication
by which the maintenance personnel are authorized to perform the maintenance activities.
The format is filled with the necessary information required to service or repair the vehicle.
It is believed that any information required to assist maintenance should be described in
shop repair order. In general, the objectives of shop repair order shall be summarized as;
· It is used for assigning and controlling of maintenance activities;
· It is used for estimating and recording a maintenance cost;
· It is used to collect data necessary for producing management reports;
· It is used for transmitting job instructions.
Maintenance clerks or shop clerks can open shop repair order. This has to be approved by
workshop supervisor or delegated foremen in order to authorize the repair work and request
the materials or parts required for the repair.
The inspectors inspect the vehicle and write maintenance instruction on shop repair order
and pass it to shop supervisor. The approved repair order is then sent to the foreman who
assigning maintenance crew. A copy of the work order is given to the crew leader as job
assignment ticket. Upon completion of the work, the foremen complete the work order and
pass it to the inspector. The inspector after making check the rectification of the fault passes
80
the repair to the maintenance clerk where information is transmitted to the history card in the
record section.
Finally, a gate pass will be issued and the vehicle is driven out of the maintenance shop.
The information that should be included in a closed shop repair orders are:
· Date of repair;
· Request for service number;
· Work order number;
· Accumulated downtime;
· Activities to be completed;
· Priority of work;
· Total cost;
· Actual labor used;
· Actual material consumed;
· Year-to-date costs;
· Vehicle/equipment identification
number;
· Repair location;
· Meter reading and type;
· Out of service date;
· In shop date;
· Out shop date;
· Repair time;
· Down time category;
· Repair type;
Parts requisition and issue ticket (PRI):- parts requisition and issue ticket (PRI) is the
format by which workshop technical personnel and warehouse staffs are communicating
with each other. It is used for requesting and issuing parts and materials required for repair.
PRI is prepared by workshop personnel whom, the material for repair is requested from the
stock. If the requested parts are available in stock, they are issued depending on the quantity
and description indicated in PRI. In case, where parts requested on PRI are not available in
the stock, purchase order is prepared (Refer Table 5.5 for sample of PRI).
Parts return ticket: - It is necessary to develop the format by which issued parts can be
returned to the stock. Thus, parts return ticket (PRT) shown in table 5.6 is recommended.
Cannibalization: - Generally cannibalization is not taken as a good solution, but some times
it may be applicable when the required parts are not found in stock and in local market.
Before cannibalization is authorized, it is necessary to conduct cost/ benefits analysis. Based
on the analysis, proposal for cannibalization must be prepared and approved by the general
manager.
Recording sheet: - in order to identify easily the types of failures and their frequency, it is
necessary to use the history card in which each failure is recorded and monitored. Every
81
occurrence of failures has to be recorded and incorporated in maintenance history.
Vehicle/equipment failure sheet will supply the following basic information:
· Establish fault areas on vehicles to know conditions leading to service breakdowns
or harmful depreciations;
· To compute vehicle availability factor;
· To assist in maintenance planning and control.
Monthly maintenance report by vehicle (table 5.7) and annual maintenance report by
vehicles (table 5.8) are recommended for effective control of implementation and
maintenance cost.

5.3 Spare parts planning and control system
Due to absence of efficient maintenance management system, it is hard to plan and
purchase most of the spare parts required for WIBSE‘s vehicle repairs. The development of
effective and efficient maintenance planning and control system is one of the major inputs,
which enables to forecast the spare parts requirement. Thus, the maintenance department
technical personnel (planners) which are assigned to maintenance planning and control task
should identify and propose the parts required for every PM and repair programs. Further
more, the information obtained from maintenance personnel, operators, and vehicle life
history should enable to increase the spare parts availability in WIBSE.
5.3.1 Classification of spare parts
In order to plan the purchase of spar parts required for PM and repair activities to be
accomplished in WIBSE, it is helpful to classify the required parts in such away that they
can be easily managed and identified. It is relevant and appropriate to apply the FSN
approach analysis to the spare parts required for vehicles and other garage equipments PM
and repairs. In FSN approach F stands for fast moving spare parts that bare utilized
frequently. S represents the slow moving (utilization) of the spare parts that are used in the
enterprise vehicles and garage equipments PM and N for non-moving parts or dead
inventory items.
Fast moving spare parts: - this represents such spares that are replaced periodically while
PM is conducted on each vehicle. Frequency of their replacement is very high compared to
slow moving and no-moving spare parts. The enterprise can make purchase order depending
on the requirement that is obtained from the maintenance planning and control unit.
The absence of parts that are categorized in fast moving class can cause the interruption of
PM activities or may cause the reuse of worn out parts and similar parts which are not exact
spares that may lead to the damage of vehicles. This is one of the causes of frequent
breakdowns revealed in WIBSE. Therefore, it is recommended to place purchase order at an
appropriate time by considering the lead time and safety stocks that can help PM activities
performed in WIBSE prior to the acquisition of new spare parts. It might be rational to make
two annual orders of fast moving items.
90
Slow moving spare parts:-the utilization of slow moving spare parts is relatively moderate
compared to non-moving parts. Replacement of such types of spar parts depends on the
existing situation of the inspected component(s) or sub-unit(s) and their function. It is
advantageous to order the parts categorized in this class prior to their utilization. The parts
categorized in this class are required for heavy maintenance and overhaul. The order of slow
moving parts should be on maintenance plan and spare part issue statistics to reduce tied-up
capital.
Non-moving spare parts:-this class comprises parts that are not replaced while PM is
conducted on different vehicle/equipments. They are used only during accidents, seizing of
engine, and during damages that require major overhaul. Most of the parts categorized in
this group are costly. Insurance components are categorized in this class. Therefore, it is
good to recommend that such parts should be stored in small amount or not at all.
Efficient supply of parts will also require systemization of the workflow in the store.
Towards this goal, a spare parts control system based either on a stock card or a
computerized stock control system is necessary. The stock card services to record receipts,
issues and makes a balance as well as to determine stock value. The maintenance department
must know the balance of spare parts. Further it is necessary to use the spare parts in first
come first out manner because if spare parts are stored for a longer time it may depreciate or
rust.
91
CHAPTER 6: WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION AND
MAINTENANCE INFORMATION SYSTEM
Considering that WIBSE is engaged in public road transport service in cross country which
covers long distances, it is necessary to have centralized as well as branch maintenance
centers (mobile maintenance) or contractor to maintain/repair its fleets in the case of road
break down. The repair branch or contractors are to be selected after through study of cost
effectiveness.
WIBSE workshops are centralized and in this case maintenance functions such as planning,
scheduling of maintenance activities, work specifications, documentation, maintenance
costing, all type of maintenance activities, procurements of parts and contracting out
maintenance are kept under direct control of the head situated in the same place. In this case
for peak work loads in particular sections the maintenance department can organize and
mobilize maintenance personnel and resources from the other sections wherever possible to
distribute the loads. This enables to utilize manpower and resources effectively and
efficiently.
6.1 Capacities of WIBSE workshops
In this section, mainly the organizational structure and staff planning of the maintenance
department are discussed. Recommendations will be forwarded based on practical situation
that are practiced, forecasted for future expectations and the past experience of the
enterprise. The existing workshop is equipped with old workshop equipments, which does
not help to provide good preventive, corrective and condition monitoring activities. This is
because the equipments are outdated and the maintenance activities taking place till now is
mainly breakdown maintenance. Furthermore the workshop is not equipped for rebuilding
parts, so that the enterprise contract out different rebuilding activities to other workshops
such as Anbessa garage, Ambo machine shop and Akaki Spare Parts Share Company. This
creates problems such as increasing down time of vehicles waiting for rebuild parts.
Since April 1999, the enterprise tries to reform the company as a whole and great focus is
given to maintenance because the vehicles availability is becoming very low hence, it is a
question of whether the enterprise continues its existence or not.
92
6.2 Organizational structure and manpower
From the organizational structure shown in fig 6.1 the maintenance department has no direct
supervising over the supply department, which purchase and supply spare parts. The relation
may be advisory type. The supply department is responsible for purchasing, stocking and
distributing of all types of items such as spare parts, stationery items, office furniture,
workshop equipment, machines as well as fuel and lubricant.
Purchasing of spare parts has to be controlled by the maintenance department hence; the
spare part portion of the supply department should under the maintenance department.
Otherwise the problem of mismatching between requirement and purchased items is
continuing as in the past years (see tables 3.5 and 3.16).

6.2.1 Maintenance Department
The maintenance department is responsible for all types of maintenance of vehicles and
machines. Planning and control of all preventive and break down maintenance of the fleet
are conducted by direct supervision of the supervisors. When operation department reports
road call, the concerned maintenance people examine the action to be taken based on the
reported phenomena. All types of maintenance including overhauling are performed by the
enterprise itself. But rebuilding of parts such as crankshaft, camshaft, cylinder re boring etc.
are taken place in Anbesa, Ambo machine shop and Akaki spare parts.

The workmen are working in two shifts but as it was already seen in the previous section
(chapter 3 tables 3.13) that there is excess manpower, for this operation revenue is decreasing
while salary related expenses are increasing (table 3.10). The organization is working on twoshift
basis, which is not recommended. In order to be profitable, WIBSE should change the
two shift working system into one shift working system while reducing workers. This
enables to have few qualified workers with better payment. Furthermore the enterprise
96
should select the busses in good condition and maintain buses in the fair status to make
good. On the other hand it has to dispose buses which are old and non profitable. Based on
the above consideration the (42 good status + some selected from the fair status) should be
selected and for these buses the following manpower are recommended.

6.3 Training
In organizations where equipments, vehicles and or machines are available to be maintained,
continuous training is indispensable to cope up with the dynamic advancement of
technology in order to compete with the market change. The important of training becomes
compulsory if new vehicles and or equipments are imported. Even if the vehicles and
equipments of WIBSE are not new and variety of makes and models are relatively less,
training is still holds valued to maintain the existing vehicles in an efficient and effective
manner. The enterprise’ s technical personnel have not taken any training for long time.
Some of the prevailing problems in WIBSE are:
· Frequent accident occurrences;
· Lack of motivation;
· Low productivity of the
maintenance department;
· Improper stock management and
spare parts planning;
· Lack of maintenance planning;
· Ignores PM;
· Work done is solely depending on
experience;
· Low supervisory activities;
· Lack of top management focus to
maintenance;
· Improper handling of tools,
equipments and vehicles
98
To minimize the effects of the above problems that face the enterprise, the establishment and
implementation of effective and efficiently training programs will be one of the important
solutions.
6.3.1 Level of training requirements
In order to develop and implement planned and efficient training program, it is vital to know
the types and level at which training should be conducted. The author recommends the
following training:
a) Top management training
Top management training includes all department heads and the general manager, which is
decision makers of the enterprise and could have save the enterprise from the accumulated
loss. The author recommends the training required for this people after examining the
problems revealed in the enterprise top management. The course may include:
· Transportation leadership
· Facilitating change through team
building
· Total quality management and
BPR
· Integral performance management
for business sector
· Strategic planning and
management for business sector
· Transport management and
customer service
b) Supervisory level training
The supervisory level training includes the training required for maintenance manager and
other top-level management people who have direct or indirect impact on vehicle/
equipment maintenance management system in the enterprise. This type of training shall be
required for all mechanical engineers that are assigned to manage and run the maintenance
department. For the development of good maintenance management system in WIBSE, it is
compulsory to train all mechanical engineers and senior diploma holders who are in the
higher position to accomplish the tasks that are related to maintenance management by
conducting supervisory level training. From the existing realities, the staff assigned to run
and manage maintenance is solely on experience. Thus, it is necessary to conduct
supervisory level training. The proposed supervisory level training shall be related but not
limited to the following:
99
-Maintenance management
· Maintenance planning
· Maintenance priorities
· Maintenance control
-Vehicle/equipment management systems;
-Inventory management system;
-Human resource management;
-Time management;
- Industrial safety;
-Maintenance facility management;
-Computer application in maintenance management
-Trouble shooting techniques using electronic instruments
c) Middle level maintenance training
In this category of training all shop foremen, inspectors, and senior mechanics and
technicians are participating. They are responsible for workshop leadership in which they
are assigned and decide on the technical matters they face in their day-to-day activities. The
type of training that is conducted for middle level maintenance supervisors must be a
combination of on-job training and classroom training. The training programs that are
required to be conducted to all middle level maintenance supervisors include:
· Industrial safety condition;
· PM scheduling;
· Cost estimation and quality control
system;
· Maintenance priorities;
· Maintenance reporting;
· PM types and their
accomplishment;
· Maintenance facility management;
· -Maintenance records and
documentation system;
· Time management;
· Employee/workers/ personnel
management;
· Condition monitoring
d) Maintenance training for operation level
All of WIBSE shop clerks and workshop technicians are grouped under this heading. The
main objectives of conducting an appropriate training for such class is remedy the existing
problems in decreasing maintenance and operational expenses. Basic knowledge is to be
100
given to the working personnel grouped in this category. By developing planned training
system, WIBSE will be able to enhance maintenance activities and to increase the potential
of vehicle availability. The types of training to be included here are:
· Shop safety and hazard prevention
· Trouble shooting techniques
· Maintenance of equipments
· Time management
· Hydraulic and pneumatic principle
e) Operators and drivers training
Most maintenance organizations or departments are overlooked operators and drivers. But it
is indispensable that vehicle drivers play great role in increasing or decreasing the service
life of vehicle /equipment. Improper handling and driving shorten vehicle life faster.
Furthermore operators and drivers are in the first line to perform primary (routine preventive
maintenance and inspection). Therefore it is strongly recommended that WIBSE should
include drivers and machine operators in the training program. The training program to be
included here are:
· Proper and Safe driving and passengers handling;
· How to perform Routine inspections and top-up if necessary before
· and after operation;
· How to repair minor faults during road breakdown;
· Road calls reporting and accident prevention;
· Techniques of trouble shooting by sounds and other operating conditions
6.3.2 Possible training institutions
There are governmental and private institutions that can provide the mentioned training in
the country. They have the ability for preparing training both by assigning skill instructors,
as well as coordinating the manpower and the materials, which are essential for the training,
required. But there are problems of identifying what type of training is required to enhance
maintenance productivity and motivation. More over, financial constraints also limit training
in higher-level programs to be conducted in the country and abroad.
The following governmental and private organizations can provide the required training, as
the author believes:
· Addis Ababa University · Ethiopian Management Institute
101
· Defense Engineering College
· Nazareth Technical College
· Road Transport Authority
· Ries Engineering Share Company
· National Motors Corporation
· Automotive Manufacturing
Company of Ethiopia (AMCE)
S.Co
· Motors and Engineering Company
of Ethiopia (MOENCO) S.Co
· Mesfin Industrial Engineering
S.Co
· Ethiopian society of Mechanical
Engineers (ESME)
· Ethiopian Society of Industrial
Engineers (ESIE)
6.4 Maintenance information system
In order to utilize the vehicles properly, it is mandatory to develop and implement efficient
and effective maintenance information system by WIBSE. The establishment of
maintenance information system helps to organize and control the enterprise’ s manpower,
vehicles/equipments so as to increase performance and maintenance productivity.
For the appropriate maintenance information system development in WIBSE, computer
could be recommended to assist information processing. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce computer system in the maintenance department information system. All data
should be properly filed and distributed to concerned personnel on time.
The adoption of maintenance information system will enable to accomplish the following
activities promptly.
· Maintenance planning and
budgeting;
· Inventory management;
· Repair and maintenance activities
report;
· Performance report;
· Maintenance cost
· Vehicles and equipments history
records;
· Lifecycle costs of vehicle;
· Spare parts records;
· Spare parts order.
Maintenance activities should report to top-level management including daily shop
accomplishments that needs attention of the management. Furthermore the report should
reflect the basic performance indicators of maintenance department. In WIBSE,
maintenance data is compiled once in three months and some time at the end of the month.
The method of gathering data is not organized, and it is for the sake of reporting. There is
102
no analysis and examining of reports to take actions for improvement.. The author
recommends using the benchmark in (appendix-A) for data gathering and reporting. The
information supplied assists in improving the observed problems and maintenance
management system.
Information can flow from bottom-up and top-down direction. The maintenance
information, which passes from bottom to top, helps the management to know the existing
situation of lower level workers and the department’ s performance level. Management can
take corrective actions wherever necessary by analyzing the information obtained from the
lower level.
In similar manner, information will flow top to down to the departments, from the
departments to the lower workers. This is basically emanated from the report obtained from
the lower and new policies and regulations to be implemented are passed by top-level
management. The information that flows from top-level management can include:
· Maintenance planning;
· Training programs;
· Policies regarding replacement and
discarding of vehicles/equipment;
· Spare parts planning and status;
· Promotion and demotion of staff
and
· Recruitment of new staffs.
It is very important to adopt efficient and effective maintenance information system, which
enables to minimize the existing problems regarding vehicle life history, maintenance
records, and maintenance cost and vehicles management.
103
CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1 Conclusions
From the previous chapters it can be concluded that WIBSE is not performing as per the
objective of its establishment. Instead of contributing to the nation’ s development; the
enterprise uses asset of the country for serving its employee. The external audit report of
1995 states “the enterprise’s accumulated loss has reached to 231% of the paid up capital.
Consequently, the viability of the enterprise is doubtful, as according to proclamation 25/84,
the loss of 75%of the capital may be a ground for the dissolution of the enterprise.” During
the past 12 years the enterprise did not have any profit record. Instead cumulates its loss to
above Birr 42 million. One of the main causes of the problems is lack of proper vehicle
maintenance management system. This problem can be minimizing by:
· Implementing preventive
maintenance
· Having replacement and disposed
· Proper spare parts planning and
control system
· Use of proper technology and
adopt appropriate training
· Having reasonable manpower and
sound organizational structure
· Improving recording and reporting
methods with flat information
system
· - Motivating employees
The existence of high percentage of poor and bad status of vehicles reveals the problem of
maintenance management system. Vehicles in poor status are allocated to operation without
proper maintenance in order to cover the route allotted; as a result considerable numbers of
vehicles are operating with financial loss. Lack of preventive maintenance, shortage of spar
parts, low quality of spare parts, and absence of performance measurement, improper data
recording and analysis are evidenced.
Higher frequency of repair and accidents caused deterioration of the vehicles from time to
time; consequently most of the vehicles do not give the expected service after repaired. It is
sufficient to see the serviceability of the vehicles in 1998 budget year which is 57%.
Therefore the problem is severe; it is a question of survival. Technical personnel are
working solely on their experience without training. Furthermore there are excess employees
with non motivating salary.
104
7.2 Recommendations
In order to solve the existing problems of maintenance management of WIBSE, it is
recommended to implement the preventive maintenance program recommended. Successful
implementation of the program and other related works is highly dependent on the
commitment of top management and availability of resources (budget, skill manpower and
reliable suppliers for spare parts). The main tasks to be performed in the implementation
process are expressed as follows:
Step 1: Conduct a panel for department heads and open a discussion about the existing
problems in maintenance. The general manager or the maintenance department head could
present the prevailing problems in maintenance. At this time the major problems that
contribute to the current situation of maintenance problems and related issues will be
discussed. In the seminar it is expected that participants should come to a conclusion that the
problems could be solved as per the author’ s recommendation and may add some points for
better improvement.
Step 2: Having completed step one successfully, form a committee with the authority of
monitoring, control and steer the implementation of sound maintenance management. The
members of the team should include:
· General Manager (chair person)
· Maintenance manager (vice chair
person)
· Supply and purchase manager
(secretary)
· Finance manager (member)
· Operation manager (member)
· Planning and follow up (member)
The steering committee has the authority to alter resources and priorities without lengthy
bureaucratic process, since the top management is included.
Step 3: Estimate and allocate the necessary budget and resources to run the required
activities such as:
-Preventive maintenance program and spare parts to perform the PM. Plan and conduct
training on maintenance and spare parts planning and scheduling which are basics for PM
implementation.
· Collect and prepare manuals and procedures
· Order spare parts based on the PM and predicted corrective maintenance
105
Step 4: Establish task groups that can perform and lead different activities to implement
sound maintenance management system. Among them a team consists of inspectors and
supervisors experienced in vehicle inspection and testing is must. This team is playing great
role in investigating the status of the vehicles.
Step 5: Collect/purchase and identify references, manuals and other important
documents/records necessary for conducting preventive maintenance programs.
Step 6: Conduct orientation and training to the task groups about the problems revealed in
the maintenance and solutions to be implemented. Within the constraints conduct training
and discussions as much as possible.
Step7: Prepare and distribute formats to conduct PM activities/programs. Think for possible
automation of data processing of maintenance activities such as database control of annual
preventive maintenance and spare parts requirement planning.
Step 8: Start PM program for the vehicles in good status. Inspect and test the vehicles in the
fair status and Perform maintenance on them depending on the inspection report selectively.
Step 9: After selection and maintenance, cumulate the fair vehicles to the PM program (start
PM program on fair vehicles)
Step 10: Estimate the cost of maintenance for each poor status vehicle. Based on the
inspection and cost estimation, partial/ complete overhauling and or the top team should
decide scraping of these vehicles. Here in addition to the cost estimation, availability of
spare parts for the maintenance type to be performed on the poor vehicles should be
considered. Take care here; overhauling, reconditioning and rebuild of poor vehicles should
compare with the expected service and revenue. Author recommends selling the poor status
vehicles and purchasing few new buses.
Step11: Prepare a replacement plan for vehicles and other garage equipments as well as
disposal policy for the bad status vehicles. For replacement plan a long-term loan may be
possible if budget is not available.
Step 12: Evaluate and monitor the program for implementation as per the objective set.
Note. PM program is an investment; so for short time do not decide by comparing the
expenses and revenues. But it is wise to observe improvements in:
· Frequency of break down
· Vehicle down time
· Availability/ serviceability
· Accident occurrences/ road call
106
· Fuel, oil and lubricant
consumption relative to
performance and
· Availability of spare parts when
needed.
Step 13: Finally revise and take correction action for deviation from the set objective.
Think about maintenance productivity. Performance based incentives should be designed
and implemented for better output and maintenance quality.
Strong relation with outsourcing contract maintenance and supplies of spare parts is
mandatory to implement the program. Replace the old workshop equipments and machines
by new one to increase the maintenance efficiency of technicians.
